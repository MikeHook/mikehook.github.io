										class="alignleft" title="AppVeyor" /></a></p>

							<p>I&rsquo;ve been using <a
									href="https://bakingwebsites.co.uk/2014/07/02/automated-azure-deployments/">Kudu to
									automate my website deployments</a> from Github to Azure for quite a while and its
								worked out great. But there
								are some limitations with it, primarily a lack of control over whether changes are
								deployed, its very much an
								all or nothing tool.</p>

							<p>The complexity of the web application I&rsquo;m maintaining reached a level where I
								wanted to ensure that the
								code builds and passes some automated tests before it is deployed. I couldn&rsquo;t see
								any way to incorporate
								those steps into a deployment pipeline with Kudu so decided to try AppVeyor. I&rsquo;d
								heard about it on <a
									href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/AppVeyorAGoodContinuousIntegrationSystemIsAJoyToBehold.aspx">Scott
									Hanselmans blog</a> and as it is free for open source projects I&rsquo;d been
								itching to give it a go!</p>

							<h2>Build it, build it</h2>

							<p>The first step was to get the website to build. Surprising as it may seem the website had
								never successfully
								built in Visual Studio as it used an old version of Umbraco which had some compile
								errors. My options were to
								either upgrade to a newer version or try and fix the compile errors. The upgrade route
								looked like it could
								take some time and fortunately Umbraco is open source so I could download the source
								code for the version with
								the issues and patch some fixes. It proved fairly straightforward, basically they has
								just missed out some
								files during the packaging of the version.</p>

							<p>So now the website built locally in Visual Studio, however MSBuild still refused to build
								the site, not great
								as AppVeyor uses MSBuild to compile the website! After some research I found that the
								problem was to do with
								MSBuild attempting to not just build the website but also publish it. As the project is
								an old style <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd547590.aspx">Visual
									Studio <em>website</em> as opposed to a <em>web application</em></a> the options
								through MSBuild were somewhat
								limited as it only exposed a subset of the options for the <a
									href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229863.aspx">aspnet
									compiler</a>. However I found that the publish option could be disabled by manually
								tweaking the solution file
								to remove the settings controlling the publish of the website, if your interested in the
								details you can see
								the change for this in <a
									href="https://github.com/MikeHook/MSTC/commit/7f352956d21ef7fb3b153fbdf756048a6849a310">this
									commit</a>. The only drawback with this technique is that Visual Studio trys to
								helpfully replace these
								settings each time you save a change to the solution file, another option I may
								investigate would be to use a
								custom build script in App Veyor.</p>

							<p>The only additional setup I needed to take to get AppVeyor to build the projects was to
								tell it to restore
								the nuget packages, as I hadn&rsquo;t checked them into source control. This was simply
								achieved by adding the
								following &lsquo;Before build script&rsquo; to the AppVeyor project settings:</p>

							<p><code>nuget restore</code></p>

							<h2>Tasty Tests</h2>

							<p>With all the solution projects building the next step was to configure the tests to run.
								With AppVeyor this
								is a zero configuration step as it auto detects any projects containing unit tests and
								runs them. However to
								speed things along you can explicitly define the path to the assembly containing your
								tests in the AppVeyor
								settings. After doing this AppVeyor gives a test runner output in the console (shown
								below) along with a <a
									href="https://ci.appveyor.com/project/MikeHook/mstc/build/tests">nice testing report
									which you can see
									directly in AppVeyor here</a>.</p>

							<p><img src="/images/posts/AppVeyorTests.png" title="AppVeyor Test Console" /></p>

							<h2>AppVeyor, meet Azure</h2>

							<p>The final part of the jigsaw was to setup automated deployments, my requirements for this
								were:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Deployment to be triggered after a successful test run (default AppVeyor behaviour)
								</li>
								<li>Deploy all added, deleted and changed files to Azure</li>
								<li>Deploy changes commited to the staging branch to the staging site</li>
								<li>Deploy changes commited to the master branch to the live site</li>
							</ul>


							<p>AppVeyor has a range of options for deployment including several specifically for Azure
								Cloud sites. However
								as my application is an old website I just wanted a basic file orientated publish and
								Web Deploy offered what I
								was looking for. There is a handy guide on the App Veyor docs for <a
									href="http://www.appveyor.com/docs/deployment/web-deploy#azure-web-sites">setting
									up Web Deploy with Azure sites</a> so I won&rsquo;t repeat that here. However there
								were some custom
								configuration steps I needed to take:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Add a path to the artifacts in App Veyor. These are the files which Web Deploy
									phyically copys to the Web
									Server. In my case this was just the whole &lsquo;website&rsquo; directory.</li>
								<li>Check the &lsquo;Remove additional files at destination&rsquo; option to ensure
									files I&rsquo;ve deleted
									locally are removed from the web server.</li>
								<li>Specify &lsquo;Skip directories&rsquo; to ensure assets and cached files for Umbraco
									are not removed. For
									my site the &lsquo;Skip directories&rsquo; setting is
									&lsquo;\App_Data;\media;\data&rsquo;.</li>
								<li>Setup 2 separate Deployment providers, with the &lsquo;Deploy from branch&rsquo;
									option set to
									&lsquo;staging&rsquo; for the staging site and &lsquo;master&rsquo; for the live
									site.</li>
							</ul>


							<p>So now whenever I push changes up to github App Veyor checks which branch I&rsquo;ve
								pushed to and runs the
								deployment provider setup for that branch, you can see what has happened at the end of
								the <a href="https://ci.appveyor.com/project/MikeHook/mstc">console
									report</a>. I&rsquo;ve been really impressed with the usability and range of options
								available in App Veyor,
								it all comes at an unbeatable price of totally free for open source projects and best of
								all I get to put these
								<a href="https://github.com/MikeHook/MSTC">cool badges on my repo</a> now!
