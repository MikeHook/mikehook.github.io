							<p>The software design process can sometimes be difficult to quantify. From an external
								perspective of a
								development team, requirements go in and working software comes out. But what exactly
								happens in the middle to
								turn the stakeholders hopes and dreams into reliable, executable code?</p>

							<p>At its core software design is a methodical, incremental engineering process and there
								are no short cuts to
								this process if we want to produce good results. However making really great software
								that will stand the test
								of time often requires a little something extra, a bit of inspiration. So where exactly
								does that spark come
								from and how can we help create the conditions to nurture it?</p>

							<h2>A sticky design problem</h2>

							<p>I&rsquo;ve recently been working on a feature to enable users to update their profiles
								through a web
								application. This is a pretty standard problem however some extra complexities were
								introduced by the target
								platform. Chief among those was the user interface which needed to be asynchronous and
								fit in with the
								applications existing front end <a
									href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">SPA framework</a>.</p>

							<p>I like to implement using the &lsquo;<a
									href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/166409/tdd-outside-in-vs-inside-out">outside
									in</a>&rsquo; approach so began with the user interface, adding one section at a
								time then abstracting any
								common patterns to make them reusable. However, after a day at the coal face writing
								code I took a step back
								and wasn&rsquo;t pleased with my results. The code was reaching a point where I was
								struggling to keep track of
								the workflow in my own head which doesn&rsquo;t exactly bode well for the poor guy that
								would inevitably need
								to modify it 6 months down the line. The trouble was no matter how hard I stared at
								those lines of code a more
								elegant and simple solution would not present itself!</p>

							<p>The very next day I woke up feeling sick and not be able to get into the office to finish
								implementing the
								UI. However, it may well have been the most productive &lsquo;time off&rsquo; work
								I&rsquo;ve had in some time.
								As I recuperated watching Hobbits and Orcs do battle on a grand scale my mind drifted
								back to the problems
								I&rsquo;d been having yesterday. It suddenly became clear to me that I had been
								abstracting at too low a level
								and trying to fit all of the behaviour into a single javascript module. However if I
								just created a single
								module per user profile element I could create a common &lsquo;interface&rsquo; for each
								module and easily
								iterate over them in the main module.</p>

							<h2>Emergent architecture</h2>

							<p>This new approach had all the hallmarks of a good design as my own reaction was along the
								lines of
								&lsquo;that is so obviously better, why didn&rsquo;t I just do it like that in the first
								place?!&rsquo; That is
								a pertinent question, and one that has probably troubled many a software developer.
								However my feeling is that
								often it is not possible to skip the &lsquo;bad design&rsquo; and go straight to the
								better solution because
								you don&rsquo;t know what all the problems are going to be until you start implementing.
								Thomas Edison summed
								this up nicely in one of his most famous quotes:</p>

							<blockquote>
								<p>What it boils down to is one per cent inspiration and ninety-nine per cent
									perspiration.</p>
								<footer><strong>Wikiquote</strong> <cite><a
											href='https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison'>Thomas Edison</a></cite>
								</footer>
							</blockquote>


							<p>While its certainly true that experience can help you see patterns and spot the problems
								earlier I think it
								is a mistake to try and design everything meticulously up front. There is bound to be
								some devil in the detail
								which makes you pivot on the design halfway through so a lot of that up front time will
								have been wasted.</p>

							<p>I find it is best to have a balance, with an initial high level draft plan for the
								implementation usually
								implemented through UML modelling. This helps guide lower level design decisions and
								keep one eye on the bigger
								picture. To make the lower level design decisions I try and stay agile, adapt the code
								as I&rsquo;m going along
								and keep complexity at a minimum.</p>

							<h2>Encouraging those aha! moments</h2>

							<p>Often my best ideas are formed away from the computer, hours or even days after the
								initial problem arose.
								The sub conscious mind is an amazing tool which can help you solve many intractable
								issues if you can give it
								the space and time to join up those dots. Despite what our employment contracts may say,
								software development
								really isn&rsquo;t a 9 to 5 job. In fact working &lsquo;harder&rsquo; during those
								office hours can sometimes
								be counter productive when it comes to making great software. Good decisions and great
								solutions are formed in
								relaxed and fresh minds, for that reason I&rsquo;d have to list my bike as one of my
								most essential software
								design tools!</p>

							<p>As developers we can encourage good software design by focussing on a couple of key
								elements:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Collaborate on design, decisions should be guided by <a
										href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ten-commandments-of-egoless-programming/">the
										ten commandments of egoless programming</a></li>
								<li>Ensure your estimates include enough contingency to allow for rapid prototyping and
									iterations during
									implementation.</li>
								<li>Stay pragmatic; aim high but know that perfection is subjective. Establishing coding
									standards can help
									guide when a design is good enough</li>
							</ul>


							<p>Do you have any particular techniques to help inspire your software designs? If so
								I&rsquo;d love to hear
								about them and try them out myself!</p>
