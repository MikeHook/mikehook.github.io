							<p>In the <a href="https://bakingwebsites.co.uk/2015/07/19/lean-awesome-part-I/">first part
									of Making awesome software with Lean principles</a> I started looking at how <a
									href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development">Lean principles</a>
								have helped me while working on the <a href="http://midsussextriclub.com/">Mid Sussex
									Tri Club website</a>.</p>

							<p>The first three principles <strong>Eliminating waste</strong>, <strong>Amplifying
									learning</strong> and <strong>Deciding as late as possible</strong> are all
								fundamental to help guide software development. However they only form part of the
								picture, there are still four more principles remaining that help guide our decisions so
								let&rsquo;s take a look at them now.</p>

							<h2>Deliver as fast as possible</h2>

							<blockquote>
								<p>In the era of rapid technology evolution, it is not the biggest that survives, but
									the fastest. The sooner the end product is delivered without major defects, the
									sooner feedback can be received, and incorporated into the next iteration.</p>
								<footer><strong>Wikipedia</strong> <cite><a
											href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development'>Lean Software
											Development</a></cite></footer>
							</blockquote>


							<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the benefits of an iterative approach over and again throughout my
								professional life so I regard this as an essential principle to apply to all software
								projects. I put in place a pretty slick release process as one of the first changes I
								made and have been reaping the benefits ever since. Basically any check-ins on the
								master branch of the source code repository are immediately deployed to the website.
								I&rsquo;ve already blogged about how I set-up this <a
									href="https://bakingwebsites.co.uk/2014/07/02/automated-azure-deployments/">&lsquo;zero-click&rsquo;
									deploy process</a> and it has worked largely without problems since set-up.</p>

							<p>However, this technique must be used with caution and certainly in tandem with the
								&lsquo;<strong>Build quality in</strong>&rsquo; principle. It is essential to ensure
								that a suitable branching process is in place too and changes can only be deployed once
								they have been tested. If you are working in a larger team I&rsquo;d recommend limiting
								write access to the master branch to a single person who can coordinate the deployments.
								While automation is great for productivity people still need to understand how it all
								works and retain control of the systems.</p>

							<h2>Empower the team</h2>

							<blockquote>
								<p>The lean approach favors the aphorism &#8220;find good people and let them do their
									own job,&#8221; encouraging progress, catching errors, and removing impediments, but
									not micro-managing.</p>
								<footer><strong>Wikipedia</strong> <cite><a
											href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development'>Lean Software
											Development</a></cite></footer>
							</blockquote>


							<p>I have been fortunate to be involved with an organisation that trusted me to make the
								technical decisions. I presented my ideas on the features to implement and got feedback
								on any changes they thought may be needed. So I was empowered to make the changes as and
								when they were needed. However I also think it is important to &lsquo;bring the
								stakeholders with you&rsquo; when making the changes. This has several benefits, not
								only does it help ensure that the features are relevant, it also gives me some good
								candidates for people to test the system before it goes live, which brings me neatly
								onto the next principle!</p>

							<h2>Build quality in</h2>

							<blockquote>
								<p>Conceptual integrity means that the systemâ€™s separate components work well together
									as a whole with balance between flexibility, maintainability, efficiency, and
									responsiveness.</p>
								<footer><strong>Wikipedia</strong> <cite><a
											href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development'>Lean Software
											Development</a></cite></footer>
							</blockquote>


							<p>As I mentioned earlier, this principle acts as a counterweight to some of the other Lean
								principles, such as <strong>Deliver as fast as possible</strong>, to help ensure that
								changes are not rushed and the software doesn&rsquo;t accumulate bugs and brittle
								implementations. For this project I&rsquo;ve not had the luxury of any other developers
								who could review the code, however I&rsquo;ve still ensured that changes are
								functionally reviewed before deploying them to the live site. To facilitate this
								I&rsquo;ve setup a &lsquo;staging&rsquo; environment using the same deployment technique
								running off a separate &lsquo;staging&rsquo; repository branch. I first implement the
								changes on the staging branch and only merge them into the live &lsquo;master&rsquo;
								branch once someone has tested them out on the staging website.</p>

							<p>On one occasion I skipped the staging process and fate taught me a lesson! The update was
								to use an Umbraco plugin to automatically resize images but little did I know that there
								was a memory leak in the Umbraco plugin which meant the site quickly went over its
								memory allocation and Azure automatically took it offline. That was a nasty surprise to
								find on the live site and some load testing in the staging environment would certainly
								have helped!</p>

							<h2>See the whole</h2>

							<blockquote>
								<p>By decomposing the big tasks into smaller tasks, and by standardizing different
									stages of development, the root causes of defects should be found and eliminated.
								</p>
								<footer><strong>Wikipedia</strong> <cite><a
											href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development'>Lean Software
											Development</a></cite></footer>
							</blockquote>


							<p>There are two key elements to the last principle, <strong>See the whole</strong>.
								I&rsquo;ve already talked about how the staging and live environments are standardized,
								in my case this was a fairly trivial exercise made easy by modern hosting tools such as
								Azure and github that enable multiple environments to be set up at very low cost. The
								small fee to run an extra Azure database is well worth the value it adds for the club.
							</p>

							<p>The second element recommends splitting tasks into smaller pieces and is certainly one
								that I&rsquo;d advocate. Limiting the number of changes made at any one time really
								helps with tracking down issues. Its a practice which I&rsquo;ve learnt the hard way
								over the years, it can be tempting to try and &lsquo;fix the world&rsquo; when you get
								your hands on a code-base and hammer out a high number of changes in a short time.
								However, not only does this massively increase the probability for bugs, it also makes
								finding them much more difficult. Looking for a bug in a commit with 50+ changed files
								isn&rsquo;t much fun!</p>

							<p>I&rsquo;ve used the <a href="https://github.com/MikeHook/MSTC/issues">github issue
									tracker</a> on this project, which may seem a bit odd when there is no one else to
								share the work with, however it has helped keep me focussed on what I&rsquo;ve been
								trying to achieve, also its nice to get the satisfaction of pressing the
								&lsquo;Closed&rsquo; button after fixing each issue!</p>

							<h2>Lean == Awesome</h2>

							<p>I hope you&rsquo;ve enjoyed reading about my experiences with Lean principles. I&rsquo;d
								love to hear about any opinions you&rsquo;ve got regarding the way I&rsquo;ve
								interpreted the principles or how you&rsquo;ve used the principles to make your own
								awesome software, so feel free to comment on the posts below!</p>
