							<p>I&rsquo;ve been a keen amateur triathlete and member the <a
									href="http://midsussextriclub.com">Mid Sussex Tri Club</a> for a couple of years.
								Its a relatively small club but there is a surprising amount of administration involved
								in running it and after chatting to some of the clubs committee members it was clear
								that the admin overheads were becoming a burden. I could see the potential for software
								to help lessen the burden so I offered to take on the club&rsquo;s website and add some
								features to it.</p>

							<p>Fast forward a year and we have a greatly enhanced website with new features that have
								helped grow the club without taking up more of people&rsquo;s time. Throughout making
								these changes I&rsquo;ve applied Lean software principles which have really helped me.
								So in this post I&rsquo;m taking a look at the first 3 principles of Lean and how these
								have assisted on this project.</p>

							<h2>Eliminate waste</h2>

							<blockquote>
								<p>Lean philosophy regards everything not adding value to the customer as waste.</p>
								<footer><strong>Wikipedia</strong> <cite><a
											href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development'>Lean Software
											Development</a></cite></footer>
							</blockquote>


							<p>I had great motivation to ensure that this principle was applied as I&rsquo;ve been
								making all the changes during my spare time. Its amazing what you can achieve in a short
								amount of time with a bit of planning. For example just last week I was able to add 2
								new payment options to the site in an hour. The key techniques I&rsquo;ve used to help
								eliminate waste are:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Make sure I understand what the key stakeholder wants to achieve from the feature
									before implementing it</li>
								<li>Design directly in HTML &ndash; I&rsquo;ve designed all the new user interfaces
									directly in HTML so when it comes to implementing the feature I just need to enhance
									the existing HTML with the dynamic data elements</li>
								<li>Use third parties to do the heavy lifting (ie. don&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel). For
									this project the key third party systems used are <a
										href="http://umbraco.com/">Umbraco</a> for content management, <a
										href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> for styling and <a
										href="https://gocardless.com/">GoCardless</a> for online direct debit payments
								</li>
							</ul>


							<h2>Amplify learning</h2>

							<blockquote>
								<p>Software development is a continuous learning process with the additional challenge
									of development teams and end product sizes.</p>
								<footer><strong>Wikipedia</strong> <cite><a
											href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development'>Lean Software
											Development</a></cite></footer>
							</blockquote>


							<p>Working in a development team of one on this particular project obviously made knowledge
								sharing a non issue, however there were opportunities to ensure learning was applied
								instead of doing things the old way. Integrating the GoCardless payment system presented
								a great opportunity for learning. The club were reluctant to extend the existing paypal
								based solution due to the fees involved, with paypal charging nearly 4% per transaction.
								So I did some research and found that the GoCardless direct debit service charged just
								1% per transaction.</p>

							<p>We decided to trial the system and I was pleasantly surprised by how intuitive it was it
								integrate with. They have <a href="https://developer.gocardless.com/">top notch
									documentation of their API</a> and client libraries for a wide range of platforms
								including ours, .NET. I had a test payment process integrated with our website within a
								couple of hours, their support was also excellent and helped clarify the few points I
								wasn&rsquo;t clear on regarding setting up specific redirect URLs.</p>

							<p>The system has been up and running for around 6 months now and the only issue we&rsquo;ve
								had was with some intermittent error responses. Again their support team looked into the
								problem as soon as I raised it and implemented a fix. I&rsquo;m glad that I took the
								time to learn how to integrate with GoCardless as it has saved our small club hundreds
								of pounds in fees already!</p>

							<h2>Decide as late as possible</h2>

							<blockquote>
								<p>As software development is always associated with some uncertainty, better results
									should be achieved with an options-based approach, delaying decisions as much as
									possible until they can be made based on facts and not on uncertain assumptions and
									predictions.</p>
								<footer><strong>Wikipedia</strong> <cite><a
											href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development'>Lean Software
											Development</a></cite></footer>
							</blockquote>


							<p>Taking this approach has helped me avoid the common &lsquo;analysis paralysis&rsquo;
								problem whereby you try and solve too many problems at once, tie yourself in knots and
								deliver nothing! I deferred the implementation of several tricky features and was
								pleasantly surprised that the solutions turned out to be more straight forward than
								I&rsquo;d originally anticipated.</p>

							<p>For example we wanted to add an online entry system for several club events however the
								we needed to accept entries from club members, affiliated club members or guests. My
								initial thinking was to have an entry form for each type of entrant with some reporting
								so the event organisers could see who had entered. This sounded like a big feature that
								would take weeks to implement. So I started by just adding a simple form for existing
								members to enter our Duathlon event (fortunately no guests were allowed for our
								Duathlon!). Later on I returned to the problem of adding guest entries and suddenly it
								became obvious to me that guests could be members of the website as well just with a
								different role to limit their access. Then the same entry forms could be used for
								everyone and I wouldn&rsquo;t have to add any new reporting. Deferring the decision for
								how to implement this feature saved me loads of time and resulted in a simpler system,
								wins all round!</p>

							<h2>Stay tuned for part II&hellip;</h2>

							<p>The first three principles of Lean development have really helped me deliver on this
								project but there are still four more principles to go, so if you&rsquo;ve found this
								interesting check back soon for part II in the series!</p>
