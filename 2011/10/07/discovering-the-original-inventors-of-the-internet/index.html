							<p>I&rsquo;m sure many of you have heard about a chap called <a
									href="http://twitter.com/#!/timberners_lee">Tim Berners Lee</a> who is widely
								credited for inventing the world wide web as we know it today. The story is well known
								and I&rsquo;m not going to re-hash it here, however less is known about who may have
								come up with the first concept of the <a
									href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a>. You may be surprised to
								hear that the origins of the concept date back several centuries and take place on an
								entirely different continent, among a race of people commonly considered quite primitive
								and barbaric. Here&rsquo;s a little hint of who these people may have been.</p>

							<p><a href="http://imageshack.com/a/img835/4400/yrbq.jpg"><img
										class="size-medium wp-image-257" title="Machu_Picchu_1"

							<h2>The internet laid bare</h2>


							<p>You may well ask how the internet could exist centuries before computers had been
								invented or even the discovery of electricity. Naturally there was no way the internet
								as we know it today could be possible, however if we look at the abstract concept there
								are strong parallels. At it&rsquo;s heart the internet is a communications system made
								up of a group of connected devices. The power of the internet lies in its ability to
								efficiently send messages through the network from one node to another. When you open
								your web browser and type in www.google.co.uk your computer sends a message to the web
								server hosting google.co.uk asking for the web page. However this message is not sent
								directly from your computer to the google web server, this would be very inefficient as
								each person that wanted to view the google web page would first need to establish a
								connection to their web server. As more people tried to connect to the same page the
								response would get slower and slower until the number of connections reached its limit.
							</p>

							<h2>Routing to the rescue</h2>


							<p>The internet has an elegant solution to this problem. Instead of attempting to establish
								a direct connection between the two end points, each of the nodes in the network just
								connects to their nearest nodes. So the end points are indirectly connected through the
								network in a similar way to this lovely node diagram:</p>

							<p><img class="size-full wp-image-252" title="onethousandpaintings_small1-300x300"
									src="http://imageshack.com/a/img834/8784/z6g.gif" alt="Network nodes" width="300" />
							</p>

							<p>Each message is sent with the address of its final destination, each node only needs to
								know what direction to send the message in order to get it closer to its destination. In
								this way the message is naturally <a
									href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing">routed</a> on the most efficient path
								from its source to the destination. It is this concept if a nodal network and message
								routing that has strong parallels with a very old method of communications.</p>

							<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:20px;"><strong>An ancient Inca
										network</strong></span></p>

							<p>I recently took a trip to Peru to hike the Inca trail to Machu Picchu. So this post is a
								(hopefully interesting) way to shoehorn some of my holiday snaps onto this blog!</p>

							<p><a href="http://imageshack.com/a/img703/8159/inq4.jpg"><img
										class="size-medium wp-image-255" title="Machu_Picchu"
										src="http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/320x240q90/703/inq4.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

							<p>However quite apart from that I learnt a great deal about the fascinating Inca culture.
								Before the trip I had thought that there was essentially one Inca trail in Peru leading
								to Machu Picchu, how wrong I was! The Inca trails actually comprised of thousands of
								miles of pathways connected across the whole of the Inca empire. They were the key to
								enabling the Inca rulers establish and run the largest single empire in South America.
							</p>

							<p>One of the main uses of the trails was as a communications network. There were small
								guard posts dotted across the network, often high up in remote mountain areas. If the
								Inca ruler wanted to send a message they would encode it using a &lsquo;<a
									href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quipus">quipus</a>&rsquo;, a device made up of
								multi-coloured plied rope, threads and knots. The exact method of encoding has
								unfortunately been lost in time but it may well of been a binary system quite similar to
								one used by computers today. It would have been quite possible to encode fairly
								sophisticated messages in this way.</p>

							<p><img class="size-full wp-image-259" title="quipus"
									src="http://imageshack.com/a/img14/4521/fqto.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

							<p>The ruler would then pass the quipus to a messenger to deliver the message. However the
								messenger would only take the message to the nearest checkpoint, then pass it onto
								another messenger who would carry the message to the next checkpoint. Each checkpoint
								would be around 5-10 KM apart, more distance for flat sections and less for mountainous
								terrain. In this way each of the messengers could run between the checkpoints as fast as
								possible and the message itself would reach its destination far quicker than would
								otherwise be possible.</p>

							<p>To give you some indication of how efficient this system was during Inca times the
								capital city was Cuzco, situated at around 3,300 metres in the middle of the Andes
								mountains, several hundred miles from the coast. However the Inca king was able to eat
								fresh fish in the capital because it was sent over the Inca trail network. It is
								estimated that the same delivery made by road transport today takes longer than an
								equivalent delivery made over the Inca network in the 15th century!</p>

							<p>So now all the pieces of the puzzle are in place we can see that the Inca trail network
								used the some communication method as today&rsquo;s internet. The trail checkpoints are
								equivalent to an internet router, the messengers have now been replaced with fibre optic
								cables and of course the quipus is directly equivalent to an <a
									href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_packet">IP network packet</a>. So there
								you have it, the Inca empire invented the alpha version of the internet.</p>
