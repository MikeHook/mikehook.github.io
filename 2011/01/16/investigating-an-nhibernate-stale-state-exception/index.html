						<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
							<p>I recently needed to investigate and fix this rather unpleasant sounding issue. It was
								occurring, seemingly at random, on a live web service but could not be replicated in
								tests. Occasionally the web service was throwing the exception when we made a call to
								delete a list of records from the database.</p>

							<p>The web service uses the NHibernate object relational mapper (ORM) tool to map our c#
								classes (domain objects ) to database tables. NHibernate was throwing this exception
								when we tried to delete the records:</p>

							<blockquote>NHibernate.StaleStateException: Unexpected row count: 0; expected: 1
							</blockquote>




							<h3>What is a stale state?</h3>


							<p>This issue was not one we had seen before and had us scratching our heads for a while.
								The first step was to understand what the exception itself meant.</p>

							<p>After some reading up in the <a href="http://nhforge.org/doc/nh/en/index.html">NHibernate
									documentation</a> it was more clear what the issue was. NHibernate was complaining
								that the in-memory model of the database data had become stale, or in other words out of
								date. So when NHibernate tried to persist the requested deletion to the database it was
								finding that it could not complete the operation.</p>

							<h3>Why was our state stale?</h3>


							<p>So, all well and good, we knew what the stale state was. However, it was rather more
								difficult to pin down why it was happening, especially because we were unable to
								reproduce the error during testing.</p>

							<p>It was only examining the event logs for the web service which enabled us to understand
								why this was happening. The event logs showed that 2 separate instances of the web
								service were being called almost simultaneously on separate threads. Both of those
								instances were basically calling the same delete operation on the same list of records.
							</p>

							<p>So the first instance would succeed in deleting the records, but the second instance
								would then also try to delete the records. Of course the second instance would fail, as
								there were not longer any records to delete.</p>

							<h3>Preventing the stale state (odour eaters?)</h3>


							<p>Once we understood why the exception was occurring it was a straight forward re-factoring
								exercise to prevent it in future. In our case the code could be updated so that the
								delete operation never needed to be called in the first place, so this was an effective
								fix.</p>

							<p>The detailed event logging on the web service proved invaluable in solving this issue,
								without this it probably would of taken much longer to figure out what was happening!
