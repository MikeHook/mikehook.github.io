<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height:13px;"><a href="http://www.python.org/download/">Install Python</a>, I went for the current version (3.3) as I don't think I will need to use any version 2 modules</span></li>
</ul>
The following steps are optional, you can write and run Python programs straight from its command line or IDLE GUI but I wanted to try a more fully featured IDE (Integrated Development Environment. By all accounts there are quite a few options but it sounded like Eclipse and PyDev had good support.
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Install Eclipse</a></li>
	<li>Install the <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/">Java runtime</a> if you don't have it</li>
	<li>Run eclipse then go to the Help -&gt; Install New Software menu and point it at the PyDev updates URL: <a href="http://pydev.org/updates" rel="nofollow">http://pydev.org/updates</a></li>
</ul>
Boom, I can now add a new PyDev project, but wait eclipse doesn't know where Python is yet. You need to configure the interpreter first, sounds complicated but you can just hit the 'Auto config' button and it finds the installed python  executable's  for you.
