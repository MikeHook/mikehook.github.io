I will be looking to develop the website iteratively and introduce fully working features 0ne at a time. With this in mind I have drawn up list of the <span style="font-weight:bold;">minimum set of features</span> the site will need for it to work:

<ul>
    <li>Add / Edit ingredients</li>
    <li>Add / Edit recipes</li>
    <li>Search for recipes + bookmark</li>
    <li>User registration / authentication</li>
    <li>Recipe book (View own recipes + bookmarked)</li>
</ul>

I will first be focusing on developing these features to try and keep some momentum on the development. Once these features are completed I can either further develop the initial feature set or introduce more. Some ideas for more <span style="font-weight:bold;">advanced features</span> are:

<ul>
    <li>Recipes reviews and ratings</li>
    <li>New recipes 'you might like' notifications by email / rss feed</li>
    <li>Generation of shopping lists from a set of recipes</li>
    <li>Multiple region support (different languages)</li>
</ul>

Thats quite enough to keep me busy for now!
Next up are the wireframes.
