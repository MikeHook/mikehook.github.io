#Software Development Episode VI: A New Dawn #

As the somewhat cheesy title suggests, changes are afoot in the world of Baking Websites. Up to this point I've been working as a permanent employee for a number of companies (five actually, hence Episode VI). But I felt that it was time to shake things up so imminently I will be starting out as a contracting software developer. While in practice I expect I will be doing much the same thing from day to day it was still quite a leap to leave the cosy environs of a permanent position. But before we get too far into that, in the best tradition of episodic film, lets take a recap on the story so far. In a galaxy far far away...

##Episode I - A lone padawan ##

The first company I worked for, [RF Solutions](http://www.rfsolutions.co.uk/), was where I made my start on the journey of software development. Fresh out of university my mind was full of theory but completely devoid of any  practical business knowledge, invoices and purchase orders were foreign concepts to me! However that soon changed and I learnt what elements went together to make a business work. 

After a brief foray into the world of 'technical sales' I gravitated towards the IT systems and was given a pretty opened ended brief of 'build us a new website where we can sell our products.' So off I went and built a site leveraging an e-commerce product called [Actinic](http://www.actinic.co.uk/). It was a fun challenge and I learnt much about how online payments worked along with how a web application could be integrated with internal business systems. I'm pleased to see that both the site I built and Actinic themselves are still going strong today, all be it in evolved forms! 

It gave me a taste for more and I set about learning all about the .Net framework and building my first custom application to process product returns. This was the first time I realized that the most difficult part can often be figuring out what you are meant to be making! It is one thing following tutorials to push data in and out of a database from a web page but quite another to apply that to a problem and come up with a solution that people will actually be able to use.

My custom application worked but I knew I could do better, if only I had some way of learning the best way to approach these problems. This was when I made my first leap of faith...
