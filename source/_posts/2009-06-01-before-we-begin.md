I've started this blog to record my progress making a website in ASP.NET MVC. I am hoping that writing a blog about the experience will help keep the development moving forwards. The motivation for making the website is to get a better understanding of the technologies that are used to build it. Therefore it is not so important that the site is unique, more that I can implement interesting and challenging features on the site to stretch the framwork. I don't expect many people will read the blog but maybe one day it will have some interesting content!

A summary of the progress so far:

<ul>
    <li>Run through tutorials on <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/">ASP.NET MVC</a>, primarily the excellent <a href="http://nerddinnerbook.s3.amazonaws.com/Intro.htm">NerdDinner tutorial</a>.</li>
    <li>Checked out <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sharp-architecture/">Sharp Architecture</a> to use as project architecture</li>
    <li>Initial idea about making the site on an online recipe book, where users can add and store their own recipes</li>
</ul>

Future targets:

<ul>
    <li>Draft some wireframes for the website</li>
    <li>Draft an initial class diagram for the project</li>
    <li>Build a prototype using Sharp Architecture</li>
</ul>

I think wireframes will be useful to help clarify what I want in terms of the sites appearance and functionality. So, I'll be putting on a designers hat (if I can find one) for a brief time and bash something out. It might not be pretty at this stage but I don't want it to delay me too much on starting the development.
