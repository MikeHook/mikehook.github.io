#Software Development Episode VI: A New Dawn #

As the somewhat cheesy title suggests, changes are afoot in the world of Baking Websites. Up to this point I've been working as a permanent employee for a number of companies (five actually, hence Episode VI). But I felt that it was time to shake things up so imminently I will be starting out as a contracting software developer. While in practice I expect I will be doing much the same thing from day to day it was still quite a leap to leave the cosy environs of a permanent position. But before we get too far into that, in the best tradition of episodic film, lets take a recap on the story so far. In a galaxy far far away...

##Episode I - A lone padawan ##

The first company I worked for, [RF Solutions](http://www.rfsolutions.co.uk/), was where I made my start on the journey of software development. Fresh out of university my mind was full of theory but completely devoid of any  practical business knowledge, invoices and purchase orders were foreign concepts to me! However that soon changed and I learnt what elements went together to make a business work. 

After a brief foray into the world of 'technical sales' I gravitated towards the IT systems and was given a pretty opened ended brief of 'build us a new website where we can sell our products.' So off I went and built a site leveraging an e-commerce product called [Actinic](http://www.actinic.co.uk/). It was a fun challenge and I learnt much about how online payments worked along with how a web application could be integrated with internal business systems. I'm pleased to see that both the site I built and Actinic themselves are still going strong today, all be it in evolved forms! 

It gave me a taste for more and I set about learning all about the .Net framework and building my first custom application to process product returns. This was the first time I realized that the most difficult part can often be figuring out what you are meant to be making! It is one thing following tutorials to push data in and out of a database from a web page but quite another to apply that to a problem and come up with a solution that people will actually be able to use.

My custom application worked but I knew I could do better, if only I had some way of learning the best way to approach these problems. This was when I made my first leap of faith...

##Episode II - Yoda lives (in many forms!)

It was no good me being in an IT department of one so I had to move on but the trouble was no company would take me on as an experienced developer. I was well aware that my skill set was limited but knew I could learn so I started out as a junior developer at [Cubeworks](https://twitter.com/cubeworks). This turned out to be one of the best decisions I ever made, the company was full of talented developers, and I went into full sponge mode absorbing a great deal about best coding practices, new frameworks and collaborating. I owe a massive debt of thanks to the guys who were working there at the time for putting up with my endless questions! Sadly Cubeworks is no more, however it does live on as part of a larger agency [MBA](http://www.mba.co.uk/) and many of the sites I helped build are still out there (Amongst others [Chichester college](http://www.chichester.ac.uk/), [GEM Motoring Assist](http://www.motoringassist.com/) and [Changing Habbits](http://www.changinghabbits.co.uk/)).

##Episode III - Do or do not. There is no try

Like a bolt out of the blue a digital agency from 'the big smoke' called [Fortune Cookie](http://www.fortunecookie.co.uk/) contacted me directly, offering me a position. It was a wrench to leave Cubeworks but the opportunity to work on big projects for international clients was too good to turn down. Again this proved to be a period of learning, however much more in how to work in big multidisciplinary teams than how to develop solutions. The first project I worked on had about 8 developers, several designers, user experience experts, project managers and one poor overworked QA guy all trying to work together to deliver software. It was obvious that the overheads for organising and communicating in a large development team increased exponentially with size. Also maintaining code quality across the project became a real challenge but more on that later!

The main program of work I was involved in was for [NetJets](https://www.netjets.com/) a complete relaunch of their online presence, with a new flight booking engine thrown in for good measure! It was a great project to work on which involved close collaboration with the client across different time zones. It was soon clear that it was essential for us to maintain a 'mock' version of the clients web services to enable us to work asynchronously, along with a suite of unit and integration tests to enable us to pin point the source of bugs. When a single user action is travelling through multiple layers of code across several applications debugging can be like going down the rabbit hole unless you have something to light your way!

##Episode IV - In a dark place we find ourselves, and a little more knowledge lights our way

Unfortunately market forces conspired against me continuing to work for Fortune Cookie (or [POSSIBLE](http://www.possible.com/) as they now were). The new projects were drying up and it was clear to me that long term the role would not be economical. So I decided to take action before someone made the decision for me. At the time the Test Driven Development movement was carrying a lot of influence in the industry and as I agreed with an approach to software development that put quality first I looked for a position that would align with my values.


##Episode V - Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future...

Working for Wiggle had given me a taste for working in a product team so I looked for a role in the same vein. Fortuitously Brightwave were looking to expand the development team for their tessello product so I jumped on board. The main product was quite a departure from all the applications I'd worked on previously, a 'single page application' with most of the code written in javascript to run client side directly in the users browser. 

The benefits to this approach are obvious when you use the application as interactions are much smoother without full page reloads and the user experience is much better. There has been tremendous growth in this area over the last couple of years with the emergence of many front end frameworks such as Angular, Backbone, Ember, React (I could go on but you get the idea!). I expect that this approach will become the norm over the next few years as any applications without smooth interactions will not be able to attract users.    

##Episode VI - Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose

Working with the tessello product team was a great experience and we made some great improvements to the platform. However the pace of change in the technology industry is clearly not slowing down and I felt I needed to make a change to enable me to keep up with these rapid changes. 

As a software developer (indeed any kind of knowledge worker) the most valuable commodity you possess is your time. Working for any company full time you effectively hand that commodity to the company and they apportion it as they see fit (quite rightly to, this is what we all sign up to when we join a company). However there is a problem with this model as opportunities to top up your knowledge bank are largely limited to concepts you encounter during your day to day work and whatever you can manage to cram in out of hours. 

My hope is that contracting work will enable me to make a bigger investment into my knowledge bank between contracts. Also I may be able to explore other opportunities in my own time which may or may not be successful but I'm sure will be fun trying! Obviously this is all theoretical right now but there is only one way to properly test a theory and that is to give it a go, so watch this space!
