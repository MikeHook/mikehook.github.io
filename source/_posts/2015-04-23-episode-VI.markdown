#Software Development Episode VI: A New Era #

As the somewhat cheesy title suggests, changes are afoot in the world of Baking Websites. Up to this point I've been working as a permanent employee for a number of companies (five actually, hence Episode VI). But I felt that it was time to shake things up so in a little over a months time I will be starting out as a contracting software developer. While in practice I expect I will be doing much the same thing from day to day it was still quite a leap to leave the cosy surrounds of a permanent position. But before we get too far into that, in the tradition of episodic film, lets take a quick look at the story so far.

##Episode I - A lone padawan ##

The first company I worked for, [RF Solutions](http://www.rfsolutions.co.uk/), was where I made my start on the journey of software development. Fresh out of university my mind was full of theory but completely devoid of any  practical business knowledge, invoices and purchase orders were foreign concepts to me! However that soon changed and I learnt what elements went together to make a business work. 

After a brief foray into the world of 'technical sales' I gravitated towards the IT systems and was given a pretty opened ended brief of 'build us a new website where we can sell stuff.' So off I went and built a site on top of a product called [Actinic](http://www.actinic.co.uk/). It was a fun challenge and I learnt much about how online payments worked along with how a web application could be integrated with internal systems in a business. I'm pleased to see that both the site I built and Actinic themselves are still going strong today, each in their evolved forms! 

It gave me a taste for more and I set about learning all about the .Net framework and building my first custom application. This was the first time I realized that the most difficult part can often be figuring out what you are meant to be making! It is one thing following tutorials to push data in and out of a database from a web page but quite another to apply that to a problem and come up with a solution that people will actually enjoy using!

My custom application worked but I knew I could do better, if only I had some way of learning the best way to approach these problems. This was when I made my first leap of faith to start again...

##Episode II - Yoda lives (in many forms!)

It was no good me being in an IT department of one so I had to move on but the trouble was no company would take me on as an experienced developer. I was well aware that my skill set was limited but I knew I could learn so I took a hefty pay cut and started out as a junior developer at [Cubeworks](https://twitter.com/cubeworks). This turned out to be one of the best decisions I ever made, the company was full of talented developers, and I went into full sponge mode and absorbed a great deal about best coding practices, new frameworks and collaborating. I owe a massive debt of thanks to the guys who were working there at the time for putting up with my endless questions! Sadly Cubeworks is no more, however it does live on as part of a larger agency [MBA](http://www.mba.co.uk/) and many of the sites I helped build a still out there, such as [Chichester college](http://www.chichester.ac.uk/), [GEM Motoring Assist](http://www.motoringassist.com/) and [Changing Habbits](http://www.changinghabbits.co.uk/).
