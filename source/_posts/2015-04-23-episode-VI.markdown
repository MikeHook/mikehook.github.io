#Software Development Episode VI: A New Era #

As the somewhat cheesy title suggests, changes are afoot in the world of Baking Websites. Up to this point I've been working as a permanent employee for a number of companies (five actually, hence Episode VI). But I felt that it was time to shake things up so imminently I will be starting out as a contracting software developer. While in practice I expect I will be doing much the same thing from day to day it was still quite a leap to leave the cosy environs of a permanent position. But before we get too far into that, in the best tradition of episodic film, lets take a recap on the story so far. In a galaxy far far away...

##Episode I - A lone padawan ##

The first company I worked for, [RF Solutions](http://www.rfsolutions.co.uk/), was where I made my start on the journey of software development. Fresh out of university my mind was full of theory but completely devoid of any  practical business knowledge, invoices and purchase orders were foreign concepts to me! However that soon changed and I learnt what elements went together to make a business work. 

After a brief foray into the world of 'technical sales' I gravitated towards the IT systems and was given a pretty opened ended brief of 'build us a new website where we can sell our products.' So off I went and built a site leveraging an e-commerce product called [Actinic](http://www.actinic.co.uk/). It was a fun challenge and I learnt much about how online payments worked along with how a web application could be integrated with internal business systems. I'm pleased to see that both the site I built and Actinic themselves are still going strong today, all be it in evolved forms! 

It gave me a taste for more and I set about learning all about the .Net framework and building my first custom application to process product returns. This was the first time I realized that the most difficult part can often be figuring out what you are meant to be making! It is one thing following tutorials to push data in and out of a database from a web page but quite another to apply that to a problem and come up with a solution that people will actually be able to use.

My custom application worked but I knew I could do better, if only I had some way of learning the best way to approach these problems. This was when I made my first leap of faith...

##Episode II - Yoda lives (in many forms!)

It was no good me being in an IT department of one so I had to move on but the trouble was no company would take me on as an experienced developer. I was well aware that my skill set was limited but knew I could learn so I started out as a junior developer at [Cubeworks](https://twitter.com/cubeworks). This turned out to be one of the best decisions I ever made, the company was full of talented developers, and I went into full sponge mode absorbing a great deal about best coding practices, new frameworks and collaborating. I owe a massive debt of thanks to the guys who were working there at the time for putting up with my endless questions! Sadly Cubeworks is no more, however it does live on as part of a larger agency [MBA](http://www.mba.co.uk/) and many of the sites I helped build are still out there (Amongst others [Chichester college](http://www.chichester.ac.uk/), [GEM Motoring Assist](http://www.motoringassist.com/) and [Changing Habbits](http://www.changinghabbits.co.uk/)).

##Episode III - Do or do not. There is no try

Like a bolt out of the blue a digital agency from 'the big smoke' called [Fortune Cookie](http://www.fortunecookie.co.uk/) contacted me directly, offering me a position. It was a wrench to leave Cubeworks but the opportunity to work on big projects for international clients was too good to turn down. Again this proved to be a period of learning, however much more in how to work in big multidisciplinary teams than how to develop solutions. The first project I worked on had about 8 developers, several designers, user experience experts, project managers and one poor overworked QA guy all trying to work together to deliver software. It was obvious that the overheads for organising and communicating in a large development team increased exponentially with size. Also maintaining code quality across the project became a real challenge but more on that later!

The main program of work I was involved in was for [NetJets](https://www.netjets.com/) a complete relaunch of their online presence, with a new flight booking engine thrown in for good measure! It was a great project to work on which involved close collaboration with the client across different time zones. It was soon clear that it was essential for us to maintain a 'mock' version of the clients web services to enable us to work asynchronously, along with a suite of unit and integration tests to enable us to pin point the source of bugs. When a single user action is travelling through multiple layers of code across several applications debugging can be like going down the rabbit hole unless you have something to light your way!
