## Intro

blah blah blah

## No more Batman and Robin

You may ask what does my blog have to do with the dynamic crime fighting duo Batman and Robin? Well the new platform is based on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), which is quite the opposite of dynamic. Using the power of Jekyll I can now generate all the static blog content (html, images, css) locally by running a couple of commands. Then I just push the changes up to github and boom, the updates are published. 

I really liked the simplicity of this approach as a blog is pretty much all about the content, there are no interactive features or dynamically changing content that would require a processing engine. The functionality can be met with good old static html. There are also a bunch of other great advantages to this approach:

- Faster page load times
- More tolerant to high loads (although I doubt the traffic on this particular blog will ever cause a problem!) 
- Free web hosting with [github pages](http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/)
- Scratches my developer itch for getting my hands dirty with the blogging platform 

  

There are some drawbacks to this approach such as a higher barrier to entry for editors, however
