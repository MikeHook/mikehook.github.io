I recently had problems with the eclipse IDE auto-complete not working.

After Googling the problem, I managed to resolve this by downloading the source for the version I was using and extracting into the Android SDK folder, as detailed in <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=7850#c8">this google code issue</a>.
