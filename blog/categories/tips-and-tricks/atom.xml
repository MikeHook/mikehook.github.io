<p>Keeping up with the inexorable rise of front end frameworks is a big challenge in modern web development is. My pathway is probably fairly common, starting out with <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> and the humble selector, progressing onto <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout</a> and embracing the joy of binding then finally onto the full on framework smorgasbord of <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular JS</a>. Now there is a new project on the horizon and Angular 2 has reached a good level of maturity, so &ldquo;Once more unto the breach, dear friends&rdquo; it is time to embrace the new all over again!</p>

<p>Our project stack is a fairly standard .net picture, an ASP.NET MVC application on the front end talking to a REST API server side based on Web Api. Angular 2 sits firmly in the front end application and can be installed through node. I won&rsquo;t go into details of that setup here as Deborah Kurata has already covered that off in her excellent <a href="http://blogs.msmvps.com/deborahk/angular-2-getting-started-with-a-visual-studio-2015-asp-net-4-x-project/">Angular 2 Getting started with Visual Studio post</a>, however the point where I hit trouble was getting the application to build on our TeamCity build server.</p>

<h2>Its Javascript Jim, but not as we know it</h2>

<p>A big benefit of Angular 2 is its built in support for coding in TypeScript, a strongly typed  superset of JavaScript that can be transpiled into JavaScript before it is executed. While TypeScript has been around for quite a while now (compared to Angular 2 anyway!) and is baked into Visual Studio I still needed to get the newest version to enable visual studio to build the scripts. This was simply a case of downloading the latest version of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48593">TypeScript for Visual Studio 2015</a> and installing.</p>

<p>Once the installation step had been repeated on our build server the compiler also ran through TeamCity. So far so good, however we didn&rsquo;t have the node_modules folder checked into source control (as they are external dependencies containing a crazy number of files!) so the Angular 2 source libraries were not present. Naturally this was a sticking point in getting our javascript code to compile or indeed run as Angular 2 didn&rsquo;t exist in the application on the build server! To fix this we needed to download all the dependencies in the node_modules folder during the build and save them into the expected location in the build servers workspace.</p>

<h2>Hey node, give me the dependencies</h2>

<p>TeamCity has a great plugin model which allows it capabilities to be easily extended and a quick google revealed that a <a href="https://github.com/jonnyzzz/TeamCity.Node">TeamCity Node plugin</a> already existed. After installing the plugin, along with Node on the build server, I was able to add a build step to execute the following command:</p>

<p><code>npm install</code></p>

<p>When this command is executed from the directory of our MVC application it interrogates the <strong>package.json</strong> file and installs all the dependencies listed in the json file. Well, that&rsquo;s what it <strong>should</strong> do, in my case all I got was a long pause followed by a network timeout, doh!</p>

<p>I was prepared for this as we are working behind a corporate firewall and I&rsquo;d already spent quite some time finding out how to get a connection from my development machine. The solution, using the Cntlm Authentication proxy, is handily documented on StackOverflow in this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18569054/npm-behind-ntlm-proxy/18570201#18570201">NPM behind NTLM proxy article</a>. However after following all the steps on the build server the network connections were still failing. I tried running the npm install locally on the build server and it worked fine so it seemed that the npm proxy settings were not being used when the program ran through TeamCity. After quite a bit of head scratching I resorted to reading the <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/files/npmrc">npm manual</a> and there were some clues as to why the config might be ignored. When I looked in my C:\Users\{MyUsername}\ folder I could see a .npmrc file with the proxy settings, however there was no such file in the C:\Users\{TeamCityAgentUser}\ folder. So I copied my .npmrc file into here then bingo, it all worked through TeamCity!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure this won&rsquo;t be the last challenge Angular 2 throws at our Dev Ops efforts but we are in a good place now with the build running inside TeamCity.</p>

    <link href="http://bakingwebsites.co.uk/2015/08/16/rebase-git-enlightenment/"/>
    <updated>2015-08-16T18:07:49+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://bakingwebsites.co.uk/2015/08/16/rebase-git-enlightenment</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://i49.photobucket.com/albums/f299/hookmike/Pat-Morita_Karate_Kid_200_zpscufzef0b.jpg" class="alignleft" title="Pat Morita" /></p>

<p>The path to Git enlightenment can be a long one for a developer used to centralized source control such as SVN.</p>

<p>The first signs of trouble usually occur when trying to apply changes from one branch of code to another. Some file change conflicts are likely if the same source file has been changed on both branches. The source control system has no way to know which changes should be kept so it will quite rightly ask the developer to choose, however this can cause some difficulty if the changes have been made by someone else who may not even be around to ask what has happened.</p>

<p>I have a feeling that the great Mr Miyagi would have loved using Git, as patience and dedication to the ways of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control">DVCS</a> are well rewarded in time. Indeed, dealing with branches is one situation where patience is important to avoid introducing regression bugs.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Patience, young grasshopper.</p><footer><strong>Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kesuke_Miyagi">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kesuke_Miyagi</a> Kesuke Miyagi</strong></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>There are a couple of different techniques which can be used to bring the changes on two branches together and the Atlassian site has a great write up of these in it&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing/">merging vs rebasing article</a>. The article describes the following scenario, you have created a <strong>feature</strong> branch from the <strong>master</strong> and made some commits to your branch. Someone else has since made some changes to the master branch which you now need to include in your branch, to get these changes you can either merge or rebase.</p>

<p>My personal preference is to use the rebase command where possible for one key reason, <strong>merge conflicts are easier to resolve!</strong> The reason for this is that when rebasing you apply <strong>your changes</strong> on top of the master changes. This is different to a merge which will apply the master changes on top of your feature changes. So effectively any conflicts which occur will be due to changes made by yourself instead of someone else. My memory may not be great but I stand roughly 100% more chance of remembering something I&rsquo;ve done as opposed to something someone else has done!</p>

<p>Hopefully you can see the benefits of this and are thinking, &lsquo;great I&rsquo;m going to give that a go!&rsquo; But before you rush off a few words of warning, there is potential for things to go horribly wrong.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>First learn stand, then learn fly</p><footer><strong>Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kesuke_Miyagi">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kesuke_Miyagi</a> Kesuke Miyagi</strong></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>The trouble comes if there are 2 people working on the feature branch who have both pushed changes to a remote repository. If you haven&rsquo;t fetched their changes before you push the rebased feature branch their changes will get overwritten and lost forever! That would be bad but Git does try to help you out by blocking the push, actually the only way you can push the rebased branch is by passing an extra parameter to <strong>force</strong> the push. So this acts as a nice reminder to think about what you are doing, only tick that &lsquo;force push&rsquo; box if you are sure your branch is fully up to date. Actually I&rsquo;d never use rebase if I had any doubt that anyone else might be working on the same branch as me.</p>

<p>A final note about rebase, it may be difficult to carry out with some Git GUI tools. Some of my colleagues like using <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">Source Tree</a> and I&rsquo;ll agree it does look nice, however it doesn&rsquo;t support this workflow well at all. After starting a rebase you get left in a weird limbo state and have to keep re-requesting to rebase the branches after each and every commit. Then once the rebase is complete there is no way to force the push through the UI, you have to drop down to the command line to complete the action. I&rsquo;d recommend giving <a href="https://code.google.com/p/gitextensions/">Git Extensions</a>, the reliable Ford Mondeo of Git GUIs, a go for this scenario, it work much more smoothly.</p>

    <link href="http://bakingwebsites.co.uk/2013/01/18/become-a-git-contortionist-with-stash/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-18T19:16:05+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://bakingwebsites.co.uk/2013/01/18/become-a-git-contortionist-with-stash</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-364 alignright" alt="Annie the Contortionist" src="http://imageshack.com/a/img856/5731/jyt7.jpg" width="300" />One of the great aspects of the Git source control system is its flexibility. Almost any sticky situation you may encounter  as a developer working with source control can be   solved with Git.</p>

<p>Take this scenario, you&rsquo;re halfway through writing a class for a new feature when you get a call.. the client has found a show stopping bug in the application and it needs to be fixed right away. To be able to fix the bug you will need to switch onto the live code branch but you can&rsquo;t go switching branches with a load of uncommitted changes.  Now you don&rsquo;t want to commit your code as its half done and won&rsquo;t even compile right now, but you don&rsquo;t want to lose the changes either&hellip; <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Stashing"><em>git stash</em></a> to the rescue!</p>

<p>When you issue the git stash command all your changes will be committed to a stack. Leaving you with no changes on your current working branch and free to branch where ever you want. So now you can switch to the live branch and do your bug fixing work. Once that is done you can simply move back to the feature branch and <em>apply</em> the stashed changes. Hey presto, you are back where you started with your uncommitted half complete work!</p>

<p>If you really get into lots of parallel work you can stash multiple times, just be sure to remember that it is a stack and your last changes you have stashed will come back off stack first.</p>

    <id>http://bakingwebsites.co.uk/2011/10/06/the-beauty-of-cherry-pick</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m loving the <a href="http://gitready.com/intermediate/2009/03/04/pick-out-individual-commits.html">cherry pick command</a> in git right now, this is the scenario that it really helps me out for.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve fixed a bug on the live branch, however before it can be published to the live website it needs to be tested. So I can first publish it to our UAT (user acceptance testing) site so the client can test the changes. However the UAT site already has a bunch of other unreleased features on it. If I merge my bug fix branch into the UAT branch it will overwrite some of the other feature changes.</p>

<p>The solution here is to &lsquo;cherry pick&rsquo; just my changes from my bug fix branch and commit those to the UAT branch. In this way git doesn&rsquo;t merge all the other differences between the live and UAT branch.</p>
