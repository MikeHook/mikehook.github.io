    <id>http://MikeHook.github.io/2013/06/13/design-patterns-without-katas</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are a number of design patterns which I have chosen not to implement a coding kata for. This is because I felt that I would either not use the pattern regularly in practice or they have alternative solutions that make the pattern redundant. However I think it is worth calling out these patterns and summarising how they work.</p>

<h2>The decorator pattern</h2>


<p>This pattern provides a way of extending a classes behaviour without using inheritance, it is defined as:</p>

<blockquote>The decorator pattern extends the functionality of individual objects by wrapping them with one or more decorator classes. These decorators can modify existing members and add new methods and properties at run-time.</blockquote>


<p>The main reason I won&rsquo;t be using this pattern much in practice is that the class structure it generates is not very clear and also the behaviour of   the classes can change depending on the order they are instantiated. So I think implementing this pattern could cause more problems than it solves, especially if the system may need to be maintained by different people at a later date.</p>

<h2>The factory pattern</h2>




<blockquote><em>The factory method pattern allows for the creation of objects without specifying the type of object that is to be created in code. A factory class contains a method that allows determination of the created type at run-time.</em></blockquote>


<p>Whilst the factory method has its uses it is basically just an implementation of sub classing, where parameters are defined as base classes to allow different derived classes to be passed at runtime. It is a straightforward pattern and the coding kata would be pretty short to implement it.</p>

<p>Also one of the main issues the factory pattern tries to solve is centralising object creation, however we generally use IoC containers which provide <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/871405/why-do-i-need-an-ioc-container-as-opposed-to-straightforward-di-code">low maintenance dependency injection</a>  out of the box. So this removes the main need for the factory pattern.</p>

<h2>The Singleton pattern</h2>




<blockquote>Ensure a class only has one instance and provide a global access point to it</blockquote>


<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-460" alt="asparagus shoot from http://sandyspringcsa.com/" src="http://imageshack.com/a/img32/7137/uwa5.jpg" width="300" />
This is a pattern which can be very useful in applications, however the implementation is so short that a coding kata would have little content. There are just a couple of pitfalls to watch out for when implementing this pattern:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span style="line-height:16px;">Ensure the implementation is  thread safe
In Java the synchronized keyword can be used on the method which returns the singleton to ensure only a single thread ever has access to the class at once. However that can lead to the second pitfall</span></li>
    <li>Consider whether you implementation offers the best performance
Using synchronization is expensive (ie. It takes the computer a relatively long time to process)</li>
</ul>


<p>This implementation avoids both of these pitfalls by creating the <em>uniqueInstance</em> when the class is first loaded:</p>

<pre style="font-family:Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace;color:#000000;background-color:#eee;font-size:12px;border:1px dashed #999999;line-height:14px;overflow:auto;width:100%;padding:5px;">public class Singleton {
  private static Singleton uniqueInstance = new Singleton();

  private Singleton() {}

  public static Singleton getInstance()  {
    return uniqueInstance;
  }
}</pre>


<p>Finally, as with the factory pattern, if you are using an IoC container then they generally provide a way to configure a class as a singleton so there is rarely a need to implement this pattern manually yourself.</p>

<h2>There may be more...</h2>


<p>Stay tuned for more patterns to be added to this post!</p>

    <link href="http://MikeHook.github.io/2013/05/29/the-observer-pattern-coding-kata/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-29T08:53:06+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://MikeHook.github.io/2013/05/29/the-observer-pattern-coding-kata</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The second design pattern I will be looking at is the Observer pattern, which is useful for safely passing data between objects. The Observer pattern is defined as:</p>

<blockquote>"a one-to-many relationship between objects so that when one object changes state all it  dependants  are notified and updated automatically".</blockquote>


<p>A good analogy for this pattern, described in the excellent <a href="http://www.headfirstlabs.com/books/hfdp/">Head First Design Patterns book</a>  is that of a magazine publisher and subscribers. Here the publisher is the <em>one</em>  in the relationship and the subscribers are the <em>many</em>. Typically the publisher will notify each of the subscribers of a new magazine edition by sending them the magazine in the post or through their e-book subscription.  Translated into the Observer pattern the Publisher is known as the Subject and the subscribers are the observers. The subject <em>notifies</em> the observers of changes in its state.</p>

<p>Some important features to note about this pattern are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Observers can not change the state of the subject and vice versa (ie. they are Loosely Coupled)</li>
    <li>The state information can be either <em>pushed</em> out to the observers by the subject or <em>pulled</em> from the subject by the observers</li>
    <li>Observers can be added and removed at any time</li>
</ul>




<h3>The brief</h3>


<p>This is our  fictitious  brief for a new system which needs to be designed. It is election time and the polls are coming in. A local TV station would like us to design a system which can keep track of the results as they arrive. There are several hundred constituencies (areas of the country) which may declare for the Blue, Red, Yellow or Green party. The TV station wants to present this data in a number of ways:</p>

<ul>
    <li>As a leader board, showing the tally for each party</li>
    <li>As a map, with each region coloured to the winning party</li>
    <li>As a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8574653.stm">Swingometer</a>  showing the proportional change and overall result</li>
</ul>


<p>We don&rsquo;t need to worry about the implementation details of these display methods, the algorithms will be provided by the TV station. Our main concern is how to design a system to pass the data between the election object and the display objects.</p>

<h3>Designing the Solution</h3>


<p>Here is the class diagram for our solution, if you would like to try implementing the solution yourself the starting point for the kata is tagged here: <a href="https://github.com/MikeHook/DesignPatterns/tree/ObserverStart">Observer Pattern Kata Start</a>.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone" alt="Observer pattern for election data" src="https://www.lucidchart.com/publicSegments/view/51892f26-05fc-4844-a25b-4c660a0087f6/image.png" width="579" height="597" /></p>

<p>We have leveraged the Observer pattern in our solution. The Election object inherits from ISubject and each of the display methods inherit from IObserver. The Election object maintains a list of the observers, we can add or remove an observer to this list using the <em>Register</em> and <em>Unregister</em> methods. When the subjects <em>Notify</em> method is called it informs each of the observers that a change has occurred by calling their <em>Update</em> method. A completed implementation for the election scenario is tagged here: <a href="https://github.com/MikeHook/DesignPatterns/tree/ObserverEnd">Observer Pattern Kata End</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://MikeHook.github.io/2013/05/07/strategy-pattern-coding-kata/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-07T08:16:49+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://MikeHook.github.io/2013/05/07/strategy-pattern-coding-kata</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been having a look at coding katas and design patterns over the last couple of weeks. If you are not familiar with either of these concepts then you can read <a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata">Uncle Bob&rsquo;s introduction to the Bowling Kata</a> and check out <a href="http://www.blackwasp.co.uk/GofPatterns.aspx">Richard Carr&rsquo;s great set of articles on design patterns</a>.</p>

<p>My main goals are to:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span style="line-height:13px;">Increase my familiarity with design patterns</span></li>
    <li>Understand how design patterns can be best applied in real life situations</li>
    <li>Develop a repeatable method for memorizing the patterns</li>
</ul>


<p>A good way to cover off all of these goals will be to develop a set of code kata&rsquo;s which can be solved by applying a design pattern.  Sounds simple? Maybe but lets get started and see how it goes!</p>

<h2>The Strategy Pattern</h2>


<p>The strategy pattern is defined as<em>   </em></p>

<blockquote><em>"a design pattern that allows a set of similar algorithms to be defined and encapsulated in their own classes." </em></blockquote>


<p>The aim of this pattern is to separate the parts of a system that may change from those which are unlikely to change, allowing for easier maintainability of the system in future.  This all sounds good in theory but you may be wondering how and where the pattern can be applied in practice. With this in mind I&rsquo;ve come up with a  fictitious brief that we can solve by utilising the Strategy Pattern.</p>

<h4>The brief</h4>


<p>A games company is developing a sports event simulator, to be built in iterations starting with simple requirements and building up to increase the complexity. The system design should allow for changes to be made by extending the existing system without changing what is already in place.</p>

<ol>
    <li>The simulator must support marathon and 10 km run events. The only requirement for these events is that the competitors can be displayed in some way (text is fine) and they can compete in the event. All competitors will compete by running.</li>
    <li>After running some events they proved to be totally chaotic so each event should now include a marshal. The marshal can also be displayed but does not compete in events.</li>
    <li>Since the glorious victory of team GB in the Olympic Triathlon the sport's popularity has increased. So the games company would now like to also support triathlon events. Again competitors must be displayed and be able to compete, however a triathlon competitor will compete by swimming, cycling and running.</li>
</ol>




<h4>Designing the Solution</h4>


<p>The starting point for this kata is available to clone from github here: <a href="https://github.com/MikeHook/DesignPatterns/tree/StrategyStart">Strategy Kata Start</a>  <a href="https://github.com/MikeHook/DesignPatterns/tree/StrategyStart">
</a></p>

<h5>Iteration 1</h5>


<p>To meet the first requirement we only need a couple of objects as shown below:</p>

<p><img class="alignnone" alt="Strategy Pattern - Design iteration 1" src="https://www.lucidchart.com/publicSegments/view/5180e984-cb84-4274-a415-68870a00005a/image.png" width="637" height="405" /></p>

<p>We can create a couple of events for marathon and 10km runs and add some runners to those events. When the simulation runs the Compete() base method is called for each of the EventAttendees to simulate them taking part in the event. Each of the runners can be displayed by a call to their <em>Render()</em> method.</p>

<h5><span style="line-height:13px;">Iteration 2</span></h5>


<p>We now need to include Marshals as part of the event, so the model is extended as below:</p>

<p><img class="alignnone" alt="Strategy Pattern - Design iteration 2" src="https://www.lucidchart.com/publicSegments/view/518380c3-ab34-42c9-a96e-71dc0a005c5f/image.png" width="707" height="492" /></p>

<p>However, there is an obvious problem with this design, as noted in the diagram. One option would be for the Marshall to override the Compete method and make it do nothing. However this will store up more trouble for us as there may be other types of event attendee later which do not compete. We would have to ensure that each of these attendees also override that method with the same &lsquo;not compete&rsquo; behaviour. There is a better way to design for this issue (there is a clue in the name of this blog post!)</p>

<h5>Iteration 3</h5>


<p>It is clear that the Compete behaviour may change frequently depending on the attendee, we can leverage the Strategy pattern to extract this behaviour into separate classes as shown below.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone" alt="Strategy Pattern - Iteration 3" src="https://www.lucidchart.com/publicSegments/view/51877f21-1fd8-4c3b-9f02-04510a0087f6/image.png" width="519" height="496" /></p>

<p>The EventAttendee base class now contains a property of type ICompeteBehaviour. Any implementation of this interface can be assigned to each instance of an EventAttendee. So the <em>Runner</em> class is assigned the <em>Run </em>behaviour and the <em>Marshall</em> class is assigned the <em>DontCompete</em> behaviour.</p>

<p>Iteration 4</p>

<p>We have one more requirement to satisfy, the design needs to be extended to allow Triathlon events to take place. Thanks to our changes in the previous iteration we can add this new requirement without making any changes to the existing classes. Here is the final structure:</p>

<p><img class="alignnone" alt="Strategy Pattern - Iteration 4" src="https://www.lucidchart.com/publicSegments/view/51878405-1770-4c88-b91a-761b0a000882/image.png" /></p>

<p>We have extended the <em>EventAttendee</em> class with a new <em>Triathlete</em> class and created a new <em>RunCycleSwim</em> implementation of the <em>ICompeteBehaviour</em> interface. You may be thinking that the same could have been achieved with a method for the behaviour on the Triathlete class, while this is true it limits the flexibility of the design. We can see the advantage of this design by adding Spectators to the simulation. They will also be assigned the DontCompete behaviour, so we have effectively shared this part of the logic without repeating the implementation.</p>

<p>The completed implementation for this kata is available on github here:  <a href="https://github.com/MikeHook/DesignPatterns/tree/StrategyEnd">Strategy Kata End</a></p>

    <link href="http://MikeHook.github.io/2011/11/20/excel-reporting-from-web-apps-using-epplus/"/>
    <updated>2011-11-20T15:20:16+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://MikeHook.github.io/2011/11/20/excel-reporting-from-web-apps-using-epplus</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have recently been working on a new feature request for the ability to generate excel reports dynamically from a web application. This kind of feature can add a lot of value to a system as it enables businesses to analyse crucial trends in data on demand.</p>

<p>However it can be challenging to generate reports in an Excel spreadsheet format from a web application. Firstly you need to have the program itself installed on the web server, which can be difficult if you are using third party hosting. Also  coding the solution itself is difficult as you either need intimate knowledge of the Excel API or, for versions of office after 2007, in depth knowledge of the OpenXML file format. But fear not there is a third option, open source to the rescue! Some clever chaps have developed the <a href="http://epplus.codeplex.com/">EPPlus library</a> which abstracts away all the nasty low level OpenXML calls and provides a nice object oriented API for dealing with directly the spreadsheet.</p>

<h2>Modelling the report data</h2>


<p>I won&rsquo;t go into too much detail on the features of the library as you can read all about it on the <a href="http://epplus.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=FAQ">EPPlus FAQ page</a> and download the samples. However one of the methods that I found really useful was the <em>LoadFromArrays</em>  method. This enables a table of data to be output to the worksheet from a list of object arrays. So you can construct a model of the data you want to display then feed it straight to the worksheet through the list. It may sound quite complicated but here is a simple example that can be easily expanded with more columns / rows:</p>

<pre style="font-family:Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace;color:#000000;background-color:#eee;font-size:12px;border:1px dashed #999999;line-height:14px;overflow:auto;width:100%;padding:5px;">string firstName = "Joe";
string lastName = "Bloggs";
var dateOfBirth = new DateTime(2000, 1, 1);
var testData = new List&lt;object[]&gt;()
                   {
                       new object[] {"First name", firstName},
                       new object[] {"Last name", lastName},
                       new object[] {"Date of birth", dateOfBirth}
                   };

using (var excelPackage = new ExcelPackage())
{
    ExcelWorksheet excelWorksheet = excelPackage.Workbook.Worksheets.Add("Test worksheet");
    //Loads the summary data into the sheet, starting from cell A1. Prints the column names on row 1
    excelWorksheet.Cells["A1"].LoadFromArrays(testData);
}</pre>




<h2>Don't get duped</h2>


<p>I generally found that the EPPlus library was reliable, however I did hit a snag during the development. The file would get generated OK but when I tried to open it in Excel a nasty message was shown:</p>

<blockquote>Excel found unreadable content in 'Test export.xlsx'. Do you want to recover the contents of this workbook?</blockquote>


<p>The file did open OK if you chose to recover, however this obviously isn&rsquo;t ideal and not acceptable for a client release. The tricky part was that no error was being thrown so I had to use a bit of guess work to track down the issue. Initially there wasn&rsquo;t much to go on, however after running some more tests on sample data I noticed that the export always worked fine if the file only included a single worksheet. However sometimes multiple worksheets would cause the &lsquo;unreadable content&rsquo; error. From there I examined each of the properties that were being set on the worksheets and narrowed the problem down to be the worksheet name itself.</p>

<p>It turns out that excel requires each worksheet to have a unique name. This is backed up in excel itself if you try and manually name to worksheets the same you get a reasonably friendly error message saying:</p>

<blockquote>Cannot rename a sheet to the same name as another sheet</blockquote>


<p>After ensuring my worksheets were uniquely named the reports always opened up without a problem. As an aside I just tried to replicate this bug through EPPlus and this time it returned a much more helpful error message, I wish it had told me this when I was originally working on the feature!</p>

<blockquote>Add worksheet Error: attempting to create worksheet with duplicate name</blockquote>




<h2>EPPlus for the win</h2>


<p>In conclusion I would recommend EPPlus to anybody who needs to generate an excel report from C# code and doesn&rsquo;t want to interface with the murky depths of the Excel API. It is a great open source library that does just what you need in the way you would expect it to work.</p>

    <link href="http://MikeHook.github.io/2011/11/07/quartz-makes-scheduling-jobs-easy-with-episerver-commerce/"/>
    <updated>2011-11-07T19:30:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://MikeHook.github.io/2011/11/07/quartz-makes-scheduling-jobs-easy-with-episerver-commerce</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://quartznet.sourceforge.net/index.html"><img class="alignright" title="Quartz rock" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Quartz,_Tibet.jpg/240px-Quartz,_Tibet.jpg" alt="Quartz rock" width="168" height="169" /></a>A common requirement for e-commerce applications is the ability to schedule jobs or tasks. I am currently working on a project which uses EPiServer Commerce and I needed to schedule an order export job.</p>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised to find that EPiServer Commerce is supplied bundled with the <a href="http://quartznet.sourceforge.net/index.html">Quartz.NET</a>  enterprise code library to facilitate these job scheduling requirements.</p>

<h3>Gentlemen, choose your weapons</h3>


<p>I had three main options available for implementing the export job, a separate windows service, an EPiServer CMS scheduled job or a Quartz job. I decided that the Quartz service was better than the option of a separate windows service because the framework was already there and available so would not increase the complexity of deployments. I also felt it was a better option than a EPiServer CMS scheduled job because Quartz runs  independently  to the website app pool so should not put the web application under greater load while it is running and potentially degrade the performance of the end user website.</p>

<h3>A 1000 foot example</h3>


<p>I&rsquo;m not going to go into a massively detailed explanation of how to implement the jobs as there is a already a good example available in the <a href="http://sdk.episerver.com/commerce/1.1.1/Content/Developers%20Guide/Architecture/LongRunProcessScheduling.htm">EPiServer Commerce dev guide</a>  along with a detailed <a href="http://quartznet.sourceforge.net/tutorial/index.html">tutorial on the Quartz .NET site</a>. However a quick overview demonstrates how intuitive it is to implement.</p>

<p>The first thing you need to do is create your job class which will run when Quartz triggers the execution. The class must inherit from the IJob interface which just has a single Execute method to implement. Here is a sample skeleton class:</p>

<pre style="font-family:Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace;color:#000000;background-color:#eee;font-size:12px;border:1px dashed #999999;line-height:14px;overflow:auto;width:100%;padding:5px;">    public class CommerceOrderExportJob : IStatefulJob
    {
        private readonly ILog _log;

        public CommerceOrderExportJob()
        {
            _log = LogManager.GetLogger(base.GetType());
            //Any other init code
        }

        public void Execute(JobExecutionContext context)
        {
            //Your export methods
        }
    }</pre>


<p>You then need to extend the config file to configure Quartz to call your job. I think all the parameters are pretty self explanatory:</p>

<pre style="font-family:Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace;color:#000000;background-color:#eee;font-size:12px;border:1px dashed #999999;line-height:14px;overflow:auto;width:100%;padding:5px;">&lt;job&gt;
    &lt;job-detail&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;OrderExportJob&lt;/name&gt;
      &lt;group&gt;all&lt;/group&gt;
      &lt;description&gt;This job exports orders from commerce&lt;/description&gt;
      &lt;job-type&gt;Your.Assembly.CommerceOrderExportJob, Your.Assembly&lt;/job-type&gt;
      &lt;volatile&gt;false&lt;/volatile&gt;
      &lt;durable&gt;true&lt;/durable&gt;
      &lt;recover&gt;false&lt;/recover&gt;
    &lt;/job-detail&gt;
    &lt;trigger&gt;
      &lt;simple&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;OrderExportJobTrigger&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;group&gt;eCommerceFramework&lt;/group&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;Fires Order Export Job&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;misfire-instruction&gt;SmartPolicy&lt;/misfire-instruction&gt;
        &lt;volatile&gt;false&lt;/volatile&gt;
        &lt;job-name&gt;OrderExportJob&lt;/job-name&gt;
        &lt;job-group&gt;eCommerceFramework&lt;/job-group&gt;
        &lt;repeat-count&gt;RepeatIndefinitely&lt;/repeat-count&gt;
        &lt;repeat-interval&gt;300000&lt;/repeat-interval&gt;
      &lt;/simple&gt;
    &lt;/trigger&gt;
  &lt;/job&gt;</pre>


<p>Hit run on the service and check the event log for any problems. Make sure to include some useful event/error logging in the job otherwise it will just be a mysterious black box! There are a couple of snags you may run into when running the job against EPiServer Commerce:</p>

<div>
<ul>
    <li>ensure that your compiled assembly is actually available in the Quartz service directory, this is different from the main commerce site bin folder so it is not enough just to include it in the commerce app references</li>
    <li>Make sure the data context has been initialised and the config file in the Quartz service directory is pointing to your database</li>
</ul>
</div>




<h3>Mining for more gems</h3>


<p>Ultimately only time will tell if Quartz was the best choice but I feel it has the best chance of high reliability and performance in the long term. I hope that, where appropriate, EPiServer can continue to expand the incorporation of proven open source libraries with their product offerings.</p>
