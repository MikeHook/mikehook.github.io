<p>If you have read my previous post on <a href="/2014/04/28/migrating-umbraco-4-mysql-to-azure-hosting/">Umbraco to Azure migration</a> the topic of this post will be of no surprise.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve inherited an application using a MySQL database which I&rsquo;d like to host in Azure. However the hosting support for a MySQL database in Azure is expensive. So I have investigated migrating the DB into an SQL Azure supported format.</p>

<h2>What about a VM?</h2>

<p>That is a good question and one I didn&rsquo;t immediately consider. The Azure platform offers so many options that sometimes the most obvious can be missed. An easy way to keep the MySQL database without needing to fork out for the <a href="https://www.cleardb.com/">ClearDB</a> service is to just spin up an Azure VM, install MySQL on the VM and host everything from there.</p>

<p>This option offers a low overhead entry to hosting the site in Azure, with a lower cost than ClearDB. However I decided not to pursue it as it negates some of the advantages of cloud hosting, one of the aspects of Azure that is attractive is how streamlined you can make the deployment process, you can either download a publish profile and deploy directly from visual studio or hook it directly into your source control and deploy on check in. Also I must admit all the shiny monitoring graphs for Azure websites are pretty cool and give you great visibility of how your hosting is performing. Granted all these features could be achieved with a VM but not nearly so easily. So, onwards with the database migration challenge!</p>

<h2>Microsoft to the rescue! (nearly)</h2>

<p>After a bit of research I decided to try using the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ssma/">SQL Server Migration Assistant</a> to migrate the database. I was hoping this would automate all the tedious work and leave me just to press a few buttons, sit back and receive all the glory and admiration. Unfortunately it wasn&rsquo;t quite that simple as there are certain data types that just don&rsquo;t have a straight conversion between MySQL and SQL Server.</p>

<h3>How many ways can you say Yes and No?</h3>

<p>At last, a simple question, surely we can all agree what &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; and &lsquo;No&rsquo; look like, after all its the basis for all digital computing! Unfortunately when it comes to technology nothing is quite that straight forward. In the world of MS SQL we have a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms177603.aspx">bit data type</a> for this function, 1 for Yes, 0 for No, simples. However the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/bit-type.html">MySQL bit data type</a> also takes a length parameter so it is only equivalent to MS SQL if the length is set to 1.</p>

<p>To complicate things further MySQL actually advise in their <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/numeric-type-overview.html">numeric types overview</a> that a TINYINT(1) data type should be used to represent a boolean value. However the actual values of this type can be anything from -128 to 127, pretty crazy huh! Unfortunately the database I am trying to migrate chose the MySQL recommended data type of TINYINT(1) and, quite understandably that is not supported by SSMA (SQL Server Migration Assistant) as a straight migration to bit. My solution for this was to craft a &lsquo;pre migration&rsquo; script to manually convert all the MySQL booleans into a bit(1) data type, which could then be migrated by SSMA by adding a custom type mapping.</p>

<p>I also made a couple of other tweaks to the MySQL database before starting the conversion:</p>

<ul>
<li>Added primary keys to the identifying columns on the tables cmsmember, cmsstylesheet, cmsstylesheetproperty and umbracouserlogins</li>
<li>Cleared out temporary data stored in the cmspreviewxml and umbracolog tables and run optimize on the tables to free up unused space</li>
</ul>


<p>I was then ready to fire up the SSMA tool and migrate the database to Azure. I won&rsquo;t go into details about this as there is already a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ssma/archive/2011/02/07/mysql-to-sql-server-migration-how-to-use-ssma.aspx">decent guide for using SSMA</a>.</p>

<h2>The Devil is in the detail</h2>

<p>After the migration there was a final synchronisation step to carry out. I needed to manually check the data types for each of the columns in the Azure DB and update any that were not correct. I found out what the types were meant to be by <a href="http://our.umbraco.org/download">downloading the same umbraco version</a> I was working with and comparing the types. I expect there is a tool that can be used to do this but the database wasn&rsquo;t particularly large so it didn&rsquo;t take too long to carry out manually.</p>

<p>Most of the changes could be made directly to the Azure tables by just changing the datatype in the management tool. However a couple of columns proved more difficult, if they were being used as primary keys in azure there was no way to change them in place so instead I copied the data into a new table which had the correct schema, removed the old table and renamed the new table. Here is an example script for the cmstasktype table:</p>

<pre><code>EXECUTE sp_rename N'[PK_cmstasktype_ID]', N'[PK_cmstasktype_ID_old]',  'OBJECT'

CREATE TABLE [Tempcmstasktype](
    [ID] [tinyint] NOT NULL,
    [ALIAS] [nvarchar](255) NOT NULL    
    CONSTRAINT [PK_cmstasktype_ID] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED 
    ([ID] ASC
    )WITH (PAD_INDEX  = OFF, STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE  = OFF, IGNORE_DUP_KEY = OFF, ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS  = ON, ALLOW_PAGE_LOCKS  = ON) ) 
GO

Insert INTO [Tempcmstasktype] ([ID], [ALIAS])
    Select  [ID], [ALIAS]   From [cmstasktype]

drop table [cmstasktype]
EXECUTE sp_rename N'Tempcmstasktype', N'cmstasktype', 'OBJECT'
</code></pre>

<p>After ensuring all the data types matched I was able to fire up the azure website and hey presto everything functioned correctly! OK I admit it wasn&rsquo;t quite that smooth as I&rsquo;d missed changing one column from an int to tinyint which broke the whole CMS admin UI but once I&rsquo;d tracked that down everything worked fine, hooray!</p>

    <updated>2014-05-23T16:04:20+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://bakingwebsites.co.uk/2014/05/23/cloud-hosting-for-prototype</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/320x240q90/838/0fsb.jpg" class="alignleft" alttext="Square peg - Round hole"  /></p>

<br/><br/>


<p>Today I am investigating cloud hosting platforms for a green field web application, there are quite a few platforms out there now, however I&rsquo;ll be looking at some of the big hitters as they are tried and tested in the marketplace.</p>

<p>The full technology stack is still under review so the hosting capabilities need to be fairly flexible however the requirements we know for sure are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Able to spin up multiple instances to run testing, staging and production environments</li>
<li>Low cost, ideally zero for testing / staging as this is grass roots project!</li>
<li>Flexibility to host a range of technologies</li>
<li>High reliability / speed (this should be a given for any hosting environment)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Contenders ready!</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to investigate 3 platforms against the main requirements above, Windows Azure, Amazon Web Services and Heroku. Each have their advantages, so lets find out which will be the best fit for our project.</p>

<h3>Azure</h3>

<p>Azure is the Microsoft Cloud offering. As such it has a Microsoft technologies leaning but is by no means limited to their stack.</p>

<h4>OS / Languages / DBs</h4>

<ul>
<li>Windows or Linux</li>
<li>.NET, Node.js, Java, PHP, Python, Ruby</li>
<li>Native DBs: Azure SQL Server</li>
<li>Third party DBs: Neo4j, MySQL, MongoDB (fiddly)</li>
</ul>


<h4>Pricing</h4>

<ul>
<li>30 day free trial then,</li>
<li>$10/month per site</li>
<li>$2.50/month per DB</li>
</ul>


<h3>AWS</h3>

<p>Amazon Web Services were one of the first cloud based hosting solutions out there. It is a mature platform with many options but lets see whether the acronyms compare favourably.</p>

<h4>OS / Languages</h4>

<ul>
<li>Windows or Linux</li>
<li>.NET, Java, PHP, Python, Ruby</li>
<li>Native DBs: SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL</li>
<li>Third party DBs: Neo4j, MongoDB, RavenDB (basically anything you can run on VM)</li>
</ul>


<h4>Pricing</h4>

<ul>
<li>12 months free for 1 instance / DB</li>
<li>$15/month per site</li>
<li>$40/month per DB</li>
</ul>


<h3>Heroku</h3>

<p>Heroku is more of a grass roots developer led cloud platform. It is well suited to an open source license free stack but will this be suitable for our application?</p>

<h4>OS / Languages</h4>

<ul>
<li>Windows or Linux</li>
<li>Node.js, Java, Python, Ruby</li>
<li>Native DBs: Postgres</li>
<li>Third party FBs: neo4j, MySQL</li>
</ul>


<h4>Pricing</h4>

<ul>
<li>1 dyno free, $35/month per extra instance</li>
<li>Dev DBs free (Up to 10K rows), Basic $9/month</li>
</ul>


<h2>And the winner is&hellip;</h2>

<p>The technology stack hasn&rsquo;t been chosen yet so we will just need to wait to see you the winner is!</p>

    <link href="http://bakingwebsites.co.uk/2014/04/28/migrating-umbraco-4-mysql-to-azure-hosting/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-28T09:58:09+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://bakingwebsites.co.uk/2014/04/28/migrating-umbraco-4-mysql-to-azure-hosting</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Why Azure</h2>

<p>I recently inherited an Umbraco version 4 site and need to setup web hosting for it. I decided that Azure would be a good option for hosting as it offers great benefits for future scalability and a good costing model. I also wanted to try it out and see what all the fuss is about!</p>

<p>There were a few steps to carry out to get the site up and running in Azure, so I&rsquo;ve documented my experience here.</p>

<h2>First steps</h2>

<ul>
<li>Obviously you need to sign up to a <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/">Windows Azure account</a>. Its free to try but you do need a credit card. I guess this makes it nice and seamless for Microsoft to start charging you if you opt to continue past the 1 month trial!</li>
<li>Now login to the portal and go to Websites &ndash;> new &ndash;> custom create &ndash;> enter details, selecting a mysql database from the drop down</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="http://imageshack.com/a/img834/4281/jf2b.png" class="alignleft" alttext="Azure create website dialog"  /></p>

<h2>Migrating the database</h2>

<ul>
<li>Click on the new website and go to the &lsquo;linked resources&rsquo; tab. The MySql Database should be listed here</li>
<li>Click the name to open ClearDB (the third party provider of MySql databases support for Windows Azure)</li>
<li>Setup MySQL workbench to connect to ClearDB using an <a href="https://github.com/CloudBees-community/tomcat-clickstack/wiki/ClearDB-::--MySQL-SSL-Connection-MySQL-Workbench">SSL connection</a>. You may also need to install OpenSSL to enable generation of the rsa key.</li>
<li>Reduce the database size to fit in the 20MB size limit by <a href="http://www.spyriadis.net/2012/07/umbraco-clear-old-document-versions-to-decrease-database-size-and-improve-performance/">removing old document versions and preview / log files.</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Uploading the web site</h2>

<ul>
<li>Download the publish profile file from your azure account. It is available on the dashboard page of your website, under the &lsquo;quick glance&rsquo; menu</li>
<li>Open the site in WebMatrix, press publish and browse to select the publish profile file you just downloaded.</li>
<li>Web Matrix will now run a diff on the files and prompt you to upload any changes to Azure.</li>
<li>In Azure go to the site configure tab and set the app settings for &lsquo;umbracoDbDSN&rsquo; and any other connection string values to the ClearDB database connection string. If you are not sure what the connection string you can get it from the &lsquo;quick glance&rsquo; menu.</li>
</ul>


<p>I like this ability to set your production connection strings / app settings in Azure. This will be help enable me to open source the code without storing these secure settings in the config files themselves.</p>

<p>Hey presto, your site should be up and running!</p>

<h2>So, what&rsquo;s the verdict?</h2>

<p>Is Azure as nice a hue as promised or is it more murky in practice? Well from my experience its all worked pretty much as expected so far. Its clear the Microsoft has invested some serious resources into the platform and unlike some of their other products (ahem Windows 8) the usability is excellent.</p>

<p>I think this is a decent work flow to initially get a site up and running. However in the long term I would want to hook up source control for the site to publish when merging to a branch. There is an option in Azure to &lsquo;Set up deployment from source control&rsquo; so I will be investigating how this works next.</p>

<p>The main drawback I currently see with this setup is that the database has a limit on the number of connections. The free version has 4 which is fair enough, given it is just for trialling. However even the paid versions have low limits of 15, 30 or 40 for $10, $50 or $100 respectively. My feeling is that these limits may well cause problems when the site is running in production. I already hit the 4 connections limit just browsing the site myself and publishing a new page and it is bound to use more when real users are browsing at the same time.</p>

<p>The SQL databases offered in Azure do not have this connections limit and would also be significantly cheaper in the long run, so I will be investigating the feasibility of migrating the Umbraco DB from MySQL into SQL.</p>

    <link href="http://bakingwebsites.co.uk/2013/04/09/integrating-episerver-7-with-mvc-next-steps/"/>
    <updated>2013-04-09T17:40:42+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://bakingwebsites.co.uk/2013/04/09/integrating-episerver-7-with-mvc-next-steps</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My previous blog post, <a title="Integrating EPiServer 7 with an existing MVC  site" href="http://bakingwebsites.co.uk/2013/03/14/integrating-episerver-7-with-an-existing-mvc-site/">Integrating EPiServer 7 with an existing MVC site</a>, outlined the initial steps to get EPiServer 7 running. However there are a number of additional steps you may need to take before your site is fully integrated.</p>

<h3>Convert any Controllers not in Areas</h3>


<p>If your site only contains controllers within Areas then you should not need to make any changes. However controllers in the root of the site will not work by default (at least for me). I found it was best to deal with these controllers on a case per case basis as the best course of action depended on the function of the controller. I implemented one of the following changes for each:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span style="line-height:13px;">Move the controller into an area. This option makes sense if the views for the controller do not have any CMS editable content</span></li>
    <li>Convert the controller to be CMS managed. Makes sense if the views need to be CMS editable (inherit from  PageController&lt;T&gt; where T is a BasePage)</li>
    <li>Convert the controller to an HttpHandler. In one case the controller did not have any views or models, it was really just a different entrypoint to the site which ran a bit of logic and redirected. In this case there was no point in retaining the controller as an HttpHanlder could do the same job more efficiently</li>
</ul>




<h3>Disable strict language routing</h3>


<p>I encountered a further issue after patching my EPiServer.Core and EPiServer.Framework nuget packages to the latest versions. None of the controller actions in the home controller worked any more except for the Index. This was fairly easy to remedy by disabling the strict language routing, via the episerver/sites/site/strictLanguageRouting config setting.</p>

<h3>Deployment Issues</h3>


<p>While its all well and good having the site running on your machine, eventually it will need to be deployed somewhere. We handle configuration changes with file transforms and I was pleased to note that the config changes required for episerver deployments are now minimised. Here is a summary list of all the settings we changed per environment:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span style="line-height:13px;">connectionStrings
</span></li>
    <li>episerver/sites/site/siteSettings/siteUrl</li>
    <li>episerver.framework/siteHostMapping/siteHosts</li>
    <li>episerver.framework/appData/basePath</li>
    <li>episerver.framework/licensing/licenseFilePath</li>
    <li>episerver.search/namedIndexingServices/services/baseUri</li>
</ul>


<p>Note, you may need to transform further settings for a load balanced site.</p>

<h5>EPiServer UI not deployed</h5>


<p>Previously with EPiServer v6 all that was needed to run the CMS interface itself was to install the application on the web server. However the EPiServer 7 UI architecture also has a number of dependencies in the {VPP}\modules folder. So ensure that these files are also present in your deployed environment, otherwise you will probably encounter the following error:</p>

<pre style="font-family:Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace;color:#000000;background-color:#eee;font-size:12px;border:1px dashed #999999;line-height:14px;overflow:auto;width:100%;padding:5px;">DirectoryNotFoundException: Could not find a part of the path '{Your site path} \Website\ClientResources\ClientResources\packages.config'</pre>




<h5>Search service configuration</h5>


<p>We have the search service configured on a local host name as the indexing service does not like to communicate over a public host name. However this caused a further issue with the service reporting that multiple hosts names could not be run for the service. Fortunately this could be remedied easily by setting the system.serviceModel/serviceHostingEnvironment/multipleSiteBindingsEnabled  setting to true.</p>

<p>Those were all the steps we needed to take to deploy the site successfully. I&rsquo;d be interested to hear your experiences if you found any other settings that need to be changed.

    <link href="http://bakingwebsites.co.uk/2013/03/14/integrating-episerver-7-with-an-existing-mvc-site/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-14T15:54:57+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://bakingwebsites.co.uk/2013/03/14/integrating-episerver-7-with-an-existing-mvc-site</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-408" alt="custom_integration" src="http://imageshack.com/a/img560/4853/3rqu.jpg" width="300" />This post assumes you have EPiServer 7 installed on your machine. If you don&rsquo;t have it then it is available from <a href="http://world.episerver.com/Download/Categories/Products/EPiServer-CMS/">EPiServer world</a>  (once you have created an account).</p>

<p>There are 2 main options for creating a new EPiServer 7 MVC stylee site:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span style="font-size:13px;">Create a new Visual studio project (after installing 'EPiServer 7 Visual Studio Integration', available from </span><a style="font-size:13px;" href="http://world.episerver.com/Download/Categories/Products/EPiServer-CMS/">EPiServer world</a><span style="font-size:13px;">)</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:19px;">Use the </span><a style="font-size:13px;line-height:19px;" href="http://world.episerver.com/Articles/Items/ASPNET-MVC-Templates-for-EPiServer-7-CMS/">EPiServer 7 MVC templates package</a></li>
</ul>


<p>For integrating with an existing site I&rsquo;d recommend using option 1, as there are far less files to integrate. However it is well worth looking at the templates package as well as this demonstrates how models and views can be implemented with EPiServer 7.</p>

<p>After creating the new Visual Studio project I remembered that EPiServer have a NuGet feed, and they do have the version 7 assemblies on NuGet. However the version numbers are slightly different to those used in the visual studio project, so make sure you specify the version numbers to NuGet when you install the packages (they are listed below). Here are the steps I followed in detail:</p>

<ol>
    <li><span style="line-height:13px;">Created a new Visual studio project using the EPiServer Web Site (MVC) template
</span></li>
    <li>Followed the EPiServer tutorial (<strong>link</strong>) to add a home page and set it to the 'start page'</li>
    <li>Upgraded my existing site to MVC 4 by installing the Microsoft ASP.NET MVC 4 nuget package (obviously not required if your existing site is already on MVC version 4.</li>
    <li>Copy across the connectionStrings.config, episerver.config,  EPiServerFramework.config, EPiServerLog.Config and FileSummary.config files</li>
    <li>Update the  siteUrl in  episserver.config.</li>
    <li>Copy the AppData, IndexingService, modules and modules bin folders.</li>
    <li>Merge the web.config files - ensure the  episerver.search baseUri is updated to point at your site address.</li>
    <li>Installed EPiServer 7 from Nuget feeds using these commands to get the correct versions:
<ul>
    <li>Install-Package EPiServer.Framework -Version 7.0.859.1</li>
    <li>Install-Package EPiServer.CMS.Core -Version 7.0.586.1</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li>Removed assembly references to Razor and System.WebPages.Razor (as was clashing with EPiServer versions)</li>
    <li>Update Controllers to inherit from  PageController&lt;T&gt; where T is a PageData class.</li>
    <li>Update Global.asax to inherit from  EPiServer.Global</li>
</ol>




<h2><strong>IoC containers clashing!</strong></h2>


<p>OK, this is the tricky bit it gets quite involved but please stay with me!</p>

<p>When I tried to run the site it now returned a &lsquo;No parameterless construct or defined for this object.&rsquo; message. Which in plainer  English  means the application can&rsquo;t create the Controller classes. This is because the site I am integrating with currently uses the Castle Windsor IoC container, however EPiServer uses the StructureMap IoC container internally. We  definitely  don&rsquo;t want two IoC containers and I can&rsquo;t see any evidence of the EPiServer container being swappable. So the only option here is to convert the current Windsor implementation to a StructureMap implementation. More information on Structure map can be found on the excellent <a href="http://docs.structuremap.net/">StructureMap documentation site</a>, however I think it is worth including an overview in this post as, whilst this isn&rsquo;t always going to be necessary for your site, I expect it will be a common problem.</p>

<h4>Add StructureMap version 2.6.1.0</h4>


<p><span style="font-size:13px;">This is available from NuGet (as this is the version used in the EPiServer 7 MVC templates package).
The command to install is:  </span><span style="font-size:13px;">Install-Package StructureMap  -Version  2.6.1.0</span></p>

<h4>Register your services with StructureMap</h4>




<ul>
    <li><span style="font-size:13px;">Copy the  StructureMapDependencyResolver and DependencyResolverInitialization  classes from the EPiServer MVC templates project.</span></li>
    <li>Convert service registration calls to register services with StructureMap instead of Windsor. This is carried out in the  ConfigureContainer method of the  DependencyResolverInitialization class.</li>
</ul>


<p>For example here is a Windsor interface registration and its equivalent StructureMap registration:</p>

<pre style="font-family:Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace;color:#000000;background-color:#eee;font-size:12px;border:1px dashed #999999;line-height:14px;overflow:auto;width:100%;padding:5px;">//Windsor registration - Here container is an implementation of IWindsorContainer
var myConfig = WebConfigurationManager.GetSection("myConfig") as MyConfig;
container.Register(Component.For(typeof(IMyConfig)).Instance(myConfig));</pre>




<pre style="font-family:Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace;color:#000000;background-color:#eee;font-size:12px;border:1px dashed #999999;line-height:14px;overflow:auto;width:100%;padding:5px;">//StructureMap registration - Here container is of type ConfigurationExpression
var myConfig = WebConfigurationManager.GetSection("myConfig") as MyConfig;
container.For&lt;IMyConfig&gt;().Use(myConfig);</pre>


<p>An example of a class registration with a singleton lifestyle:</p>

<pre style="font-family:Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace;color:#000000;background-color:#eee;font-size:12px;border:1px dashed #999999;line-height:14px;overflow:auto;width:100%;padding:5px;">//Windsor registration
container.Register(Component.For(typeof(Cache)).Instance(HttpContext.Current.Cache).LifestyleSingleton());</pre>




<pre style="font-family:Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace;color:#000000;background-color:#eee;font-size:12px;border:1px dashed #999999;line-height:14px;overflow:auto;width:100%;padding:5px;">//StructureMap registration
container.For(typeof(Cache)).Singleton().Use(HttpContext.Current.Cache);</pre>




<ul>
    <li><span style="font-size:13px;">Convert  </span><em style="font-size:13px;">IWindsorInstaller</em><span style="font-size:13px;">  implementations  to  </span><em style="font-size:13px;">Registry</em><span style="font-size:13px;">  subclasses.</span></li>
</ul>




<h4>Debugging your StructureMap registrations</h4>


<p>You can debug structure map by adding this line:</p>

<pre style="font-family:Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace;color:#000000;background-color:#eee;font-size:12px;border:1px dashed #999999;line-height:14px;overflow:auto;width:100%;padding:5px;">_container.AssertConfigurationIsValid();</pre>


<p>Initially EPiServer was reporting many registration failures but you can delay the call until the InitComplete event is called in the DependencyResolverInitialization class. Then most of the EPiServer  registrations have completed and it is easier to see if there are any issues with your own services.</p>

<h4>Manually retrieving a service</h4>


<p>Generally my services are injected into constructors automatically, however I had a couple of calls to retrieve services manually from the IoC container. For example, to retrieve an implementation of an interface called IMyService:</p>

<pre style="font-family:Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace;color:#000000;background-color:#eee;font-size:12px;border:1px dashed #999999;line-height:14px;overflow:auto;width:100%;padding:5px;">_var myService = DependencyResolver.Current.GetService&lt;IMyService&gt;();</pre>




<h4>Last steps</h4>


<p>Hopefully your site will be running now, there is some additional configuration work you may want to do for EPiServer 7 VPP folders. But if you&rsquo;ve made it this far you will probably need a break!</p>
