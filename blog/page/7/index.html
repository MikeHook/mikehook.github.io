	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Its pretty straight forward to generate a simple web page, there are several software tools available that will generate the mark up code for you. However, even using these tools, it is easy to misuse tags and not conform to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/">XHTML standards</a>. If you were unfortunate enough to follow the previous link, you may well be thinking,</p>

<blockquote>   What does it all mean, my web page looks fine so does compliance really matter?   </blockquote>


<p>This is a valid point, however compliance is widely regarded to be important for a number of reasons. These are pretty <a href="http://www.leemunroe.com/how-important-is-valid-html-web-standards/">well documented</a> around the web so I   ll just highlight a couple of the reasons that I think are most important.</p>

<p>Firstly a compliant web page should be assured of displaying fairly consistently across all major browsers, both now and in the future. Unfortunately some browsers are more compliant than others, internet explorer still demands some extra attention but it is much improved since the days of IE6. The newer browsers which have come onto the market, such as Firefox and Chrome, generally display compliant pages very well. Secondly I think that compliance is important as it makes the content more accessible to machine readers. For example the readers used by search engines will be able to read and index the page content easier, which will help increase traffic to the site. This theory has actually been tested and there is some evidence to back up the claims that <a href="http://www.hobo-web.co.uk/seo-blog/index.php/official-google-prefers-valid-html-css/">Google prefers valid HTML and CSS</a>.</p>

<h4>Keep it clean</h4>


<p>The first step to compliance is to separate the HTML mark-up from the presentation using a CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) document. This helps ensure that the web page is short and the content is easy to find. Apparently search engines are busy guys and they just don   t have the time to be reading all that content on your site. So they only read up to a certain number of characters, if your important content is pushed too far down the document then there is a rick that it will never get indexed.</p>

<p>I   ve gone for a fairly straight forward layout on the recipe stash site, with a fixed width page of 960 pixels to target resolution widths of 1024 and above. The header, footer and main content are all in a single column. This layout can be created in CSS without too much trouble. I   ve tried to use the HTML tags as they were intended originally, for example the menus are tagged as an unordered list of elements, then styled to display horizontally.</p>

<p>There is an unfortunate limitation with HTML, it does not support curved corners. So I   ve used to <a href="http://www.html.it/articoli/niftycube/index.html">Nifty Corners</a> to create the curved effect on the top navigation menu and latest recipes section:</p>

<p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_5hQeqbPSrks/S3SKU8XP19I/AAAAAAAAAEg/LyqqweIM2DE/s1600-h/recipestash-nav%5B4%5D.jpg"><img title="recipestash-nav" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_5hQeqbPSrks/S3SKVdVr1qI/AAAAAAAAAEk/xCnYOpYSNAI/recipestash-nav_thumb%5B2%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="recipestash-nav" width="492" height="56" /></a></p>

<p>Nifty Corners is a JavaScript based tool which adds HTML and CSS to the page when it is loaded to create the effect of curved corners. The other option I considered to create the curved corners was to cut out images of the corners themselves and position them in the corners of the HTML elements. However I decided to use Nifty corners for a number of reasons:</p>

<ul>
    <li>No images are required</li>
    <li>The generated HTML mark-up is compliant</li>
    <li>The implementation is fast     just one line of JavaScript to call!</li>
    <li>It degrades gracefully (If JavaScript is not available then it does nothing)</li>
</ul>




<h4>Exceptions to the rule</h4>


<p>I mentioned earlier that internet explorer interprets style sheets differently to other browsers. This is so pronounced for version six that a completely different style sheet would be needed to create the same visual layout. I   ve decided that this would take up too much of my time and have instead used the <a href="http://forabeautifulweb.com/blog/about/universal_internet_explorer_6_css/">universal ie6 style sheet</a>, along with an upgrade message for anyone that is using IE6.</p>

<p>I   m currently running on Windows Vista and it is pretty tricky to test for all versions of internet explorer. There are two main methods that can be used to test, either install a virtual machine running Windows XP with IE6 installed natively or use the <a href="http://www.my-debugbar.com/wiki/IETester/HomePage">IETester</a> program. I   ve gone for the IETester program, mainly because it is quicker to install and doesn   t take up a huge chunk of my hard drive. I   ve tried it out and it displays the basically styled page I would expect to see in IE6 mode:</p>

<p><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_5hQeqbPSrks/S3SKV6LNNrI/AAAAAAAAAEo/-kTCMp0wAF0/s1600-h/IETester2%5B3%5D.jpg"><img style="border:0 none;" title="IETester2" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_5hQeqbPSrks/S3SKWZVC3DI/AAAAAAAAAEs/JO8fB75k_mA/IETester2_thumb%5B1%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IETester2" width="481" height="471" /></a></p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><span style="color:#000000;">The deficiencies of Internet Explorer versions seven and eight are less pronounced and I only needed to modify a couple of elements to give the same appearance to the web page:</span></span></p>

<ul>
    <li>Added fixed widths to the main div elements so margins are applied</li>
    <li>Extra div element wrapper on the so the margin is applied</li>
    <li>Add fixed widths to the navigation menu elements to fix nifty corners in ie7</li>
</ul>




<h4>Validating the page</h4>


<p>It would be difficult to judge when the mark up and styling of a web page is actually valid, fortunately there are many tools freely available on the web to help. During development I generally use the <a href="http://users.skynet.be/mgueury/mozilla/">HTML validator</a> Firefox extension. This provides a little icon in the bottom right corner of the web browser that indicates whether the current page is valid or not. Clicking the icon brings up a list of validation errors for the page. I like this tool as it is quick to browse through a site and check the validation on each page.</p>

<p>I   ve also included links to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortiums</a> XHTML and CSS <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">validation services</a> in the page footer. This will submit the current page to their online validation tools and display a report with suggestions for any problems that are found.</p>

<p>Well that   s just about all I   ve got on compliance, however if you   re after a more    hard line    message then you can <a href="http://www.entertonement.com/clips/fhzjhvmbgv--You-have-20-seconds-to-complyRobocop-Jon-Davison-Ed-209-">check this out</a>!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I   ve finished updating the mock-up for the recipe stash home page and converted it into a web page. There is a screen grab of the page below, unfortunately you can   t poke around the HTML and CSS but believe me it is all there! In this post I   m going to outline the decisions I   ve taken for the visual design of the page. The next post will go into the considerations I   ve taken to ensure the site will be standards compliant and work across all the major browsers. If that sounds a bit dry don   t worry I   ll be adding in some cheesy headings for your entertainment.</p></p>

<table style="width:auto;"><tbody>     <tr>       <td><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/8nH-_cfzbS3Wio7y4hrQQw?authkey=Gv1sRgCL7W-eqGn5fIcA&amp;feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_5hQeqbPSrks/S2XR_Y8L0jI/AAAAAAAAAEE/xqw-y6LPaPo/s400/recipestash-home.jpg" /></a></td>     </tr>      <tr>       <td style="text-align:right;font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:11px;">From <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/hook.mike/BakingWebsites?authkey=Gv1sRgCL7W-eqGn5fIcA&amp;feat=embedwebsite">Baking Websites</a></td>     </tr>   </tbody></table>




<h4>Top to tail</h4>


<p>The most immediate visual change you will probably notice, compared to the original mock-ups, is the header and footer background colour. This was a handy hint from the senior designer at <a href="http://www.cubeworks.co.uk">Cubeworks</a>, so thanks Jesse! I much prefer how this breaks up the page and gives a clear separation between the main content and the rest of the page.</p>

<h4>Press my buttons</h4>


<p>I put a bit of time into making a big shiny    Search    button to use in the header. I found it surprisingly tricky to choose a button that draws attention to the user but doesn   t stick out horribly from the rest of the design. I   m not entirely happy with the selection but I think its good enough for now. Another button image can easily be dropped in latter if I feel the need.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

<h4>Tabs for Navs</h4>


<p>Another major change in the design (and another top tip from Jesse) is a move away from the vertical icon based navigation menu in favour of a horizontal tabbed menu. This is a more conventional means of user navigation and will probably be easier for them to understand. I   m happy with how the visuals have turned out on the tabbed menu, keeping colours in line with the rest of the site and curved corners for a more current feel.</p>

<h4>Heading Home</h4>


<p>I   ve retained the icons that were originally used on the navigation. They are now displayed to the left hand side of the main h1 page heading. These icons are one of the few graphical elements on the site so I   m pleased that there is still a place for them here. I think they provide an immediate prompt to the user as to which section they are in, complimenting the nav menu highlighting and h1 heading text itself.</p>

<h4>Colour me red</h4>


<p>Although not really shown in the image above, the plan is to still use a different colour for each of the main sections, which will be most evident in the main navigation and heading colours. This point will be one to revisit once I   ve completed the other section pages.</p>

<p>&lt;</p>

<p>p&gt;That just about wraps up the main visual changes for the home page.&#160; In the next post I   ll be taking a look behind the scenes at the technical decisions I   ve made to generate the page.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>The recipestash website is flush with a shiny new domain name, however it was sadly lacking in any kind of visual design. Up to now I   ve been working with a generic style sheet downloaded from <a href="http://www.freecsstemplates.org/">free CSS templates</a> however I think it is poorly suited to the site. So I   ve put some time into making some mock-ups in Photoshop. </p></p>

<p>I   ve identified the site homepage, main search page and    Add a recipe    pages as the main areas to mock up. The remaining sections can be investigated later. The design mock-ups for each of the pages are shown below (full size versions can be viewed in the <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/hook.mike/BakingWebsites?authkey=Gv1sRgCL7W-eqGn5fIcA&amp;feat=embedwebsite">Picasa web album</a>).</p>

<p>I   ve gone for a minimal design on the homepage, the header will be used across all pages on the site and includes the site name, main search bar and login controls for the current user. The main content on the homepage highlights each of the four sections on the site which will be used most often. I   ve chosen a different colour for each of the main sections, hopefully this will give users a visual feel of where they are on the site. The four icons on the left will be displayed on all of the pages and be used as the main means of navigation. I   ll be looking to use some jQuery to display the section names when each of the icons is hovered over. If javascript is not available in the browser then a simple navigation menu will be displayed in the header.</p>

<h4><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/rGAahgUi9lxqrOS69MuHoQ?authkey=Gv1sRgCL7W-eqGn5fIcA&amp;feat=directlink">Browse recipes</a></h4>




<table style="width:auto;"><tbody>     <tr>       <td><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/rGAahgUi9lxqrOS69MuHoQ?authkey=Gv1sRgCL7W-eqGn5fIcA&amp;feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_5hQeqbPSrks/S04japbJMsI/AAAAAAAAAC0/sW00NCbkFyc/s400/browse-2.png" /></a></td>     </tr>      <tr>       <td style="text-align:right;font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:11px;">From <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/hook.mike/BakingWebsites?authkey=Gv1sRgCL7W-eqGn5fIcA&amp;feat=embedwebsite">Baking Websites</a></td>     </tr>   </tbody></table>


<p>The    Browse recipes    page can be reached from either the navigation menu or the search bar. The main features of the page are:</p>

<h5>Search keywords</h5>


<p>If the page has been reached from a search the top section displays the keywords which have been searched for. Each of these can be removed from the search by pressing the    x    icon next to the keyword.</p>

<h5>Filters </h5>


<p>Each of the filters are a simple checkbox, which will cause the results to display only those matching the filters. I may include an    apply filters    button for accessibility as performing a postback on the checkbox selection would most likely require some javascript to operate.</p>

<h5>List of recipes </h5>


<p>The list of recipes will include summary information for each of the recipes, as shown in the mock-up above. The ordering of the recipes can be controlled by clicking on the column headings. I will look to colour one of the headings to indicate which is currently being used to order the results.</p>

<h5>More recipes link </h5>


<p>Clicking the link will cause more recipes to be loaded to the bottom of the search results.&#160;&#160;</p>

<h4><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/cC7X3M6u_Jo1M_AuXDawQw?authkey=Gv1sRgCL7W-eqGn5fIcA&amp;feat=directlink">Add a recipe</a></h4>




<table style="width:auto;"><tbody>     <tr>       <td><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/cC7X3M6u_Jo1M_AuXDawQw?authkey=Gv1sRgCL7W-eqGn5fIcA&amp;feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_5hQeqbPSrks/S0pHr70y72I/AAAAAAAAACw/f6YE3GYZR-0/s400/add-recipe-1.png" /></a></td>     </tr>      <tr>       <td style="text-align:right;font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:11px;">From <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/hook.mike/BakingWebsites?authkey=Gv1sRgCL7W-eqGn5fIcA&amp;feat=embedwebsite">Baking Websites</a></td>     </tr>   </tbody></table>


<p>The functionality of the    Add a recipe    page is already largely complete. The above styling will need to be applied to the pages to format the form as displayed above. It may be tricky to apply the styling shown to the text boxes but there are other sites using similar effects so I can probably find some hints for the required CSS techniques from them!</p>

<p>&lt;</p>

<p>p&gt;Next up I will be looking to generate some HTML and CSS to match the mock-ups which can be used in the website views.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>With the turn of the year disappearing behind us, I thought it was about time that the site I   m developing got a proper identity. Initially I would of liked recipebook.com, but that is far too obvious a name to be left unclaimed, also I think its quite boring and sounds too similar to facebook. So my main criteria for the name were that it should be related to the content, engaging, easy to remember, not too derivative and of course available!</p></p>

<p>After plugging some names into the lookup tool the two front runners were recipestore.net and recipestash.net. I liked recipestore as it conveys the main idea of the site as a storage place for your recipes. However it can also be interpreted as meaning a shop for recipes, which is not ideal as the recipes will all be freely available on the site. So I settled on recipestash, which I think meets all the criteria and is less derivative than recipestore. In virtual celebration of the new domain here   s a picture of a lovely looking muffin (Image shared under creative commons on Flickr by rachellake).</p>

<p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_5hQeqbPSrks/S0pA-VC2-DI/AAAAAAAAACk/ApIIbuAxR84/s1600-h/muffin-rachellake%5B5%5D.jpg"><img title="muffin-rachellake" border="0" alt="muffin-rachellake" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_5hQeqbPSrks/S0pA-79n5tI/AAAAAAAAACo/vGJoHZjWy5A/muffin-rachellake_thumb%5B3%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="504" height="337" /></a>&#160;</p>

<p>&lt;</p>

<p>p&gt;Deciding on the domain also has a fringe benefit of motivating me to get on with the site! Its a bit of a waste not doing anything with the domain so I   m going to try and get the site up as soon as possible with the core features. The site can be refined and updated with extra features after the initial release.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I   ve been developing the recipe book website mostly using TDD (Test Driven Design) and I thought it would be interesting to measure the code coverage of my unit tests. After researching what tools were available it looked like <a href="http://www.ncover.com/">NCover</a> was the best fit for the sites technology stack. The commercial version has some good features, such as measures for cyclomatic complexity, however it is a bit out of my budget (of approximately   0!). Fortunately a <a href="http://www.ncover.com/download/community">community edition of NCover</a> is also available for free and it stills works just fine for analysing current .NET assemblies.</p>

<p>After installing NCover a console application is available for running code coverage analysis. I got this up and running but the command line interface isn   t exactly the most user friendly and the output is just a single summary report. I obviously wasn   t alone in these conclusions because back in 2006 Grant Drake developed the <a href="http://www.kiwidude.com/blog/2006/01/ncoverexplorer-debut.html">NCoverExplorer tool</a> to provide a GUI front end to NCover. This tool also has a community edition available (version 1.4) that works with the community edition of NCover.</p>

<h4>Starters - Setting up NCover Explorer</h4>


<p>The tool is fairly straight forward to setup, the NCover website includes instructions on how to setup the professional edition to <a href="http://docs.ncover.com/how-to/running-ncover-with-your-unit-testing-framework/nunit/">profile an NUnit test project</a>, and the settings are equivalent in the community edition. I also chose to specify which assemblies should be included in the coverage report as otherwise all the Sharp Architecture assemblies are included and the results are skewed.</p>

<p>After running the tool you are provided with an interactive view of the assemblies with the uncovered lines displayed in red. You can see how easy it is to identify the offending lines in the screen grab below:</p>

<p><a style="margin-bottom:1em;margin-right:1em;" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5hQeqbPSrks/Sx15F3sFlqI/AAAAAAAAAA8/yrLagOXdmxc/s1600/NCoverExplorer2.jpg"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_5hQeqbPSrks/Sx1745WamzI/AAAAAAAAAB4/PAdEtdGUeBE/s800/NCoverExplorer2.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a></p>

<h4>The Main Course     Improving code coverage</h4>


<p>The results of my first report are shown below:</p>

<p><a href="http://imageshack.com/a/img268/8057/6zqn.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31" title="NCover Report" src="http://imageshack.com/a/img268/8057/6zqn.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The prime candidates for improvement were:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The RecipeBook.Data assembly. A couple of repository classes were not tested.</li>
    <li>The RecipeBook.Web.Controllers assembly. Some of the code paths in the controller methods were not covered.</li>
    <li>The RecipeBook.ApplicationServices assembly. Not tested at all, oops!</li>
</ul>


<p>By default NCover sets the acceptable coverage level at 95%, however I felt that this was overly strict. I would rather spend the time writing fewer tests that I ensure are of a high quality than writing tests just to cover every single line of code. So I reduced the threshold to 80% and added tests to cover the essential missing features. Below if my much more healthy looking report.</p>

<h4>For Desert     A report without the red sauce</h4>


<p>OK maybe I   m stretching the food analogy a little too far with my headings now! By red sauce I mean those nasty red bars that were blazed across nearly every line of the report. Below you can see the report looks much more healthy after adding some unit tests and trimming some unused code:</p>

<p><a href="http://imageshack.com/a/img163/5125/23o5.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32" title="NCover Report - 80% coverage" src="http://imageshack.com/a/img163/5125/23o5.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I will endeavour to keep the coverage level at a minimum of 80% from now, and hopefully add some more tests to bump off those remaining pesky red bars!</p>

<p>As usual, any comments on this post are welcome. :)</p>
