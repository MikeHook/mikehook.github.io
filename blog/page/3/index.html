		<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-364 alignright" alt="Annie the Contortionist" src="http://imageshack.com/a/img856/5731/jyt7.jpg" width="300" />One of the great aspects of the Git source control system is its flexibility. Almost any sticky situation you may encounter  as a developer working with source control can be   solved with Git.</p>

<p>Take this scenario, you&rsquo;re halfway through writing a class for a new feature when you get a call.. the client has found a show stopping bug in the application and it needs to be fixed right away. To be able to fix the bug you will need to switch onto the live code branch but you can&rsquo;t go switching branches with a load of uncommitted changes.  Now you don&rsquo;t want to commit your code as its half done and won&rsquo;t even compile right now, but you don&rsquo;t want to lose the changes either&hellip; <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Stashing"><em>git stash</em></a> to the rescue!</p>

<p>When you issue the git stash command all your changes will be committed to a stack. Leaving you with no changes on your current working branch and free to branch where ever you want. So now you can switch to the live branch and do your bug fixing work. Once that is done you can simply move back to the feature branch and <em>apply</em> the stashed changes. Hey presto, you are back where you started with your uncommitted half complete work!</p>

<p>If you really get into lots of parallel work you can stash multiple times, just be sure to remember that it is a stack and your last changes you have stashed will come back off stack first.</p>

		<p><img class="alignright" title="Tux, the Linux Mascot" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Tux.png/220px-Tux.png" alt="" width="220" height="261" />
A landmark decision was made last week by Microsoft&rsquo;s ASP.NET web development team. They announced that three key technologies used to develop web applications, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2012/03/27/asp-net-mvc-web-api-razor-and-open-source.aspx">ASP.NET MVC, Web API and Razor would be made fully Open Source</a><sup>1</sup>. This is a big step for a company built on the sales of Closed Source software. I&rsquo;m going to have a look at what I think this decision means for the consumers, who use software built with these technologies, and the stakeholders who commission the software.</p>

<h2>Open Sesame</h2>


<p>For those those not involved directly in software development, the moniker &lsquo;Open Source&rsquo; may conjure up images of magicians pulling rabbits out of a hat<sup>2</sup>. However the reality could be viewed as the opposite of magic as Open source demystifies the software development process. In the traditional &lsquo;Closed Source&rsquo; licencing model, software is made by a company behind closed doors and the code is encrypted before release to the public. The traditional thinking is that this protects the company by preventing third parties from stealing their intellectual property. This is a subject of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_patent_debate">some debate</a>  , which I won&rsquo;t go into here. However it is clear that many businesses are currently successful without relying on restrictive software patents.</p>

<p>In an Open Source licencing model, the full unencrypted source code will be published at the same time as the software itself (indeed often before-hand in the case of preview and beta releases). Also, as in the case of this announcement, public contributions may be accepted to modify the original source code. Naturally the acceptance process is completely at the discretion of software company, so unhelpful or damaging contributions will not be accepted.</p>

<p>A good example of the Open Source model working commercially is the Android operating system released by Google. A massive range of mobile devices run Android and it is not only the key competitor to Apple&rsquo;s iOS (iPhones &amp; iPad operating system but has helped ensure that most devices using Microsoft&rsquo;s Windows Mobile operating system are sitting on the scrap heap. I for one am glad that there is healthy competition to the world of Apple and its clone army of i-device accolytes.</p>

<h2>Software that Just Works</h2>


<p>From a consumer or stakeholder viewpoint the natural desire is to want software that &lsquo;just works&rsquo; and to reach that goal we just need to fix all the bugs in the software. Unfortunately the belief that all software bugs can be fixed is generally  infeasible  given time and budget restraints, due to the nature of programming the two go hand in hand. In each piece of code there are many paths that can be travelled, much like a maze in a country mansion garden. If you ask 10 different people to walk the maze the chances are each one will set off in a different direction. Most of them will hit a dead end before finding their way through and a nasty bug could be hiding at each of these dead ends!</p>

<p>However Open Source software helps minimize the number bugs by accepting contributions to fix any that are found by the development community. In this way the software benefits from the knowledge of a much wider group of people than could be acheived if it was developed and maintained soley by a single company. Most software developers are driven by that itch to &lsquo;make stuff work&rsquo; and are only too happy to contribute to a project which helps make this happen. The end result is a product that is more reliable for the consumers and stakeholders and has the appearance of &lsquo;just working&rsquo;.</p>

<h2>Security concerns</h2>


<p>Typically the biggest obstruction to making software Open Source is the perceived risk to security. If anybody can view exactly how the software is operating then it is much easier for hackers to cause the software to break, exploit a vulnerability to propogate a virus or carry out other nefarious acts. The <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2012/03/29/asp-net-mvc-now-accepting-pull-requests.aspx">indications by Phil Haack</a>, a former member of the MVC team, are that this decision by Mircosoft is no exception. So a great deal of credit should go to those involved at Microsoft for making change happen in their organization.</p>

<p>Regarding the perceived risks to security, Open Source can actually reduce the risk for similar reasons to the improvement in relibility. Any security vulnerabilities will quickly be picked up by the community and fixed. The Open Source culture of continual improvement in the software makes for a much more secure product.</p>

<p>Take the example of web browsers, a couple of years ago Microsoft&rsquo;s Internet Explorer browser had massive market share. However over time so many security vulnerabilities were exploited in the browser that the <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1037530/us-government-warns-internet-explorer">US government themselves warned against using the software</a>!   Along came Mozilla&rsquo;s Firefox browser to save the day, with much improved security. Naturally Firefox has always been developed under an Open Source licence as explained in the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/about/manifesto.html">Mozilla manifesto</a>.</p>

<h2>Future developments</h2>


<p>The likelyhood is that this announcement will not trigger a deluge of community updates and fixes to the frameworks in question. I anticipate that a minority of change submissions will make it back into the frameworks themselves. However it does demonstrate an important change in mindset from Microsoft and may well signal the beginnings of a new approach for the organisation. It is clear that in the fast moving world of software and digital media you need to adapt to survive and it is encouraging that even massive organisations such as Microsoft are able to do this.</p>

<h5>Footnote</h5>


<p><sup>1</sup>While the MVC framework has been open source since its original release, this announcement widens the license model to the Web API and Razor frameworks and also marks the first time that Microsoft will accept public contributions to the open source frameworks. If you are unfamiliar with these technologies then further information is available on the Microsoft blah blah (LINK).</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>Or maybe thats just my fertile imagination!</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="http://bakingwebsites.co.uk/2012/01/25/footy-links-alpha-released/" itemprop="url">Footy Links Alpha Released</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p><img class="size-full wp-image-332 alignleft" title="FootyLinksLogo" src="http://imageshack.com/a/img834/6565/3iks.jpg" alt="" width="150" />The very first version of Footy Links is now available for download from the Android Market.
You can get the app by opening the following website on your android device and press the &lsquo;Install&rsquo; button:
<a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=mhook.FootyLinks">Footy Links on the Android Market</a></p>

<h2>What is Footy Links?</h2>


<p>Footy links is a game designed to test your football knowledge by guessing clubs connecting premiership football players.  Make your guess by clicking on the blue text then selecting the club badge matching the answer.</p>

<p>There is a basic scoring system following these rules:</p>

<ul>
    <li>+1 point for every correct guess of a &#8216;top six&#8217; club</li>
    <li>+2 points for a correct guess of any other club</li>
    <li>-1 point each time you skip to another question without answering the previous one</li>
</ul>




<h2>Can I play it?</h2>


<p>If you have an Android based mobile device I hope so, it should work on any device with Android OS version 2.2 or above. If you have any problems running the game feel free to contact me here on <a href="http://bakingwebsites.co.uk">my blog</a> or through <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/michael_hook">twitter</a></p>

<h2>Is that it?</h2>


<p>As you may be able to tell from the title, in the spirit of agile development (or maybe just because I&rsquo;m lazy), this is an early version with the absolute minimum set of features. I really wanted to just get a version out there in the wild to see if it will work on anyone&rsquo;s phone other than my own!</p>

<p>But do not fear, more versions are planned with lots of exciting extra features, possibly including:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Harder difficulty levels - more links to guess between each of the players</li>
    <li>More advanced scoring system</li>
    <li>Multi-player games</li>
    <li>Online high score board</li>
    <li>Inclusion of all English leagues</li>
    <li>Inclusion of  European  league clubs</li>
</ul>


<p>If you have any suggestions about Footy Links then please feel free to get in contact with me  here on  <a href="http://bakingwebsites.co.uk">my blog</a>  or through  <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/michael_hook">twitter</a></p>

<h2>The Techy Bit</h2>


<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in how the app works behind the scenes, the source is freely available for viewing on my github account here:
<a href="https://github.com/MikeHook/FootyLinks">Footy  Links on github</a></p>

<p>The source consists of two applications</p>

<ul>
    <li>A .NET application written to import the football club and player data into a Sqlite database</li>
    <li>An android application for the game itself</li>
</ul>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>This post was drafted some time ago, so some of the details are lost in the mists of time. But I&rsquo;ll provide links to the source so anyone interested in doing something similar can start from there.</p>

<p>The android app I&rsquo;m developing needs to be able to connect to an existing SQLite database, there are not many examples of how to achieve this in the Android tutorials, however I was able to find some guidance in a post from another Android developer on the <a href="http://www.reigndesign.com/blog/using-your-own-sqlite-database-in-android-applications/">reigndesign blog</a></p>

<p>The key is that the database needs to be copied internally to the system directory on the device running the application before it can be accessed. This doesn&rsquo;t seem particularly efficient but I&rsquo;m sure Android had their reasons! My modified version of the code to do this is available from my github repository here:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/MikeHook/FootyLinks/blob/master/AndroidApp/src/mhook/FootyLinks/Data/FootyLinksSQLLiteHelper.java">FootyLinksSQLLiteHelper.java</a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also encountered a couple of other snags since then while working with the SQLite database.</p>

<h3>No password support</h3>


<p>Passwords do not appear to be supported at all for the Android applications. I&rsquo;d automatically added password protection to the database when creating it and it took me a while to figure out why eclipse was refusing to read it!</p>

<h3>Manually delete after schema changes</h3>


<p>I&rsquo;ve added some additional fields to the database over time. However initially they were not being copied into the version of the database in my device emulator. I found it was necessary to browse the emulator files themselves, using the DDMS perspective in Eclipse, and delete the old database file directly in the emulator file system.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I have recently been working on a new feature request for the ability to generate excel reports dynamically from a web application. This kind of feature can add a lot of value to a system as it enables businesses to analyse crucial trends in data on demand.</p>

<p>However it can be challenging to generate reports in an Excel spreadsheet format from a web application. Firstly you need to have the program itself installed on the web server, which can be difficult if you are using third party hosting. Also  coding the solution itself is difficult as you either need intimate knowledge of the Excel API or, for versions of office after 2007, in depth knowledge of the OpenXML file format. But fear not there is a third option, open source to the rescue! Some clever chaps have developed the <a href="http://epplus.codeplex.com/">EPPlus library</a> which abstracts away all the nasty low level OpenXML calls and provides a nice object oriented API for dealing with directly the spreadsheet.</p>

<h2>Modelling the report data</h2>


<p>I won&rsquo;t go into too much detail on the features of the library as you can read all about it on the <a href="http://epplus.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=FAQ">EPPlus FAQ page</a> and download the samples. However one of the methods that I found really useful was the <em>LoadFromArrays</em>  method. This enables a table of data to be output to the worksheet from a list of object arrays. So you can construct a model of the data you want to display then feed it straight to the worksheet through the list. It may sound quite complicated but here is a simple example that can be easily expanded with more columns / rows:</p>

<pre style="font-family:Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace;color:#000000;background-color:#eee;font-size:12px;border:1px dashed #999999;line-height:14px;overflow:auto;width:100%;padding:5px;">string firstName = "Joe";
string lastName = "Bloggs";
var dateOfBirth = new DateTime(2000, 1, 1);
var testData = new List&lt;object[]&gt;()
                   {
                       new object[] {"First name", firstName},
                       new object[] {"Last name", lastName},
                       new object[] {"Date of birth", dateOfBirth}
                   };

using (var excelPackage = new ExcelPackage())
{
    ExcelWorksheet excelWorksheet = excelPackage.Workbook.Worksheets.Add("Test worksheet");
    //Loads the summary data into the sheet, starting from cell A1. Prints the column names on row 1
    excelWorksheet.Cells["A1"].LoadFromArrays(testData);
}</pre>




<h2>Don&#8217;t get duped</h2>


<p>I generally found that the EPPlus library was reliable, however I did hit a snag during the development. The file would get generated OK but when I tried to open it in Excel a nasty message was shown:</p>

<blockquote>Excel found unreadable content in &#8216;Test export.xlsx&#8217;. Do you want to recover the contents of this workbook?</blockquote>


<p>The file did open OK if you chose to recover, however this obviously isn&rsquo;t ideal and not acceptable for a client release. The tricky part was that no error was being thrown so I had to use a bit of guess work to track down the issue. Initially there wasn&rsquo;t much to go on, however after running some more tests on sample data I noticed that the export always worked fine if the file only included a single worksheet. However sometimes multiple worksheets would cause the &lsquo;unreadable content&rsquo; error. From there I examined each of the properties that were being set on the worksheets and narrowed the problem down to be the worksheet name itself.</p>

<p>It turns out that excel requires each worksheet to have a unique name. This is backed up in excel itself if you try and manually name to worksheets the same you get a reasonably friendly error message saying:</p>

<blockquote>Cannot rename a sheet to the same name as another sheet</blockquote>


<p>After ensuring my worksheets were uniquely named the reports always opened up without a problem. As an aside I just tried to replicate this bug through EPPlus and this time it returned a much more helpful error message, I wish it had told me this when I was originally working on the feature!</p>

<blockquote>Add worksheet Error: attempting to create worksheet with duplicate name</blockquote>




<h2>EPPlus for the win</h2>


<p>In conclusion I would recommend EPPlus to anybody who needs to generate an excel report from C# code and doesn&rsquo;t want to interface with the murky depths of the Excel API. It is a great open source library that does just what you need in the way you would expect it to work.</p>
