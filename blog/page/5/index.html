                    src="http://imageshack.com/a/img834/6565/3iks.jpg" alt="" width="150" />The very first version of
                  Footy Links is now available for download from the Android Market.
                  You can get the app by opening the following website on your android device and press the
                  &lsquo;Install&rsquo; button:
                  <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=mhook.FootyLinks">Footy Links on the Android Market</a>
                </p>

                <h2>What is Footy Links?</h2>


                <p>Footy links is a game designed to test your football knowledge by guessing clubs connecting
                  premiership football players. Make your guess by clicking on the blue text then selecting the club
                  badge matching the answer.</p>

                <p>There is a basic scoring system following these rules:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>+1 point for every correct guess of a &#8216;top six&#8217; club</li>
                  <li>+2 points for a correct guess of any other club</li>
                  <li>-1 point each time you skip to another question without answering the previous one</li>
                </ul>




                <h2>Can I play it?</h2>


                <p>If you have an Android based mobile device I hope so, it should work on any device with Android OS
                  version 2.2 or above. If you have any problems running the game feel free to contact me here on <a
                    href="https://bakingwebsites.co.uk">my blog</a> or through <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/#!/michael_hook">twitter</a></p>

                <h2>Is that it?</h2>


                <p>As you may be able to tell from the title, in the spirit of agile development (or maybe just because
                  I&rsquo;m lazy), this is an early version with the absolute minimum set of features. I really wanted
                  to just get a version out there in the wild to see if it will work on anyone&rsquo;s phone other than
                  my own!</p>

                <p>But do not fear, more versions are planned with lots of exciting extra features, possibly including:
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Harder difficulty levels - more links to guess between each of the players</li>
                  <li>More advanced scoring system</li>
                  <li>Multi-player games</li>
                  <li>Online high score board</li>
                  <li>Inclusion of all English leagues</li>
                  <li>Inclusion of European league clubs</li>
                </ul>


                <p>If you have any suggestions about Footy Links then please feel free to get in contact with me here on
                  <a href="https://bakingwebsites.co.uk">my blog</a> or through <a

                <h2>The Techy Bit</h2>


                <p>If you&rsquo;re interested in how the app works behind the scenes, the source is freely available for
                  viewing on my github account here:

              <div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
                <p>This post was drafted some time ago, so some of the details are lost in the mists of time. But
                  I&rsquo;ll provide links to the source so anyone interested in doing something similar can start from
                  there.</p>

                <p>The android app I&rsquo;m developing needs to be able to connect to an existing SQLite database,
                  there are not many examples of how to achieve this in the Android tutorials, however I was able to
                  find some guidance in a post from another Android developer on the <a
                    href="http://www.reigndesign.com/blog/using-your-own-sqlite-database-in-android-applications/">reigndesign
                    blog</a></p>

                <p>The key is that the database needs to be copied internally to the system directory on the device
                  running the application before it can be accessed. This doesn&rsquo;t seem particularly efficient but
                  I&rsquo;m sure Android had their reasons! My modified version of the code to do this is available from
                  my github repository here:</p>

                <p><a
                    href="https://github.com/MikeHook/FootyLinks/blob/master/AndroidApp/src/mhook/FootyLinks/Data/FootyLinksSQLLiteHelper.java">FootyLinksSQLLiteHelper.java</a>
                </p>

                <p>I&rsquo;ve also encountered a couple of other snags since then while working with the SQLite
                  database.</p>

                <h3>No password support</h3>


                <p>Passwords do not appear to be supported at all for the Android applications. I&rsquo;d automatically
                  added password protection to the database when creating it and it took me a while to figure out why
                  eclipse was refusing to read it!</p>

                <h3>Manually delete after schema changes</h3>


                <p>I&rsquo;ve added some additional fields to the database over time. However initially they were not
                  being copied into the version of the database in my device emulator. I found it was necessary to
                  browse the emulator files themselves, using the DDMS perspective in Eclipse, and delete the old
                  database file directly in the emulator file system.</p>

                  itemprop="url">Excel Reporting From Web Apps Using EPPlus</a></h1>
              <div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
                <p>I have recently been working on a new feature request for the ability to generate excel reports
                  dynamically from a web application. This kind of feature can add a lot of value to a system as it
                  enables businesses to analyse crucial trends in data on demand.</p>

                <p>However it can be challenging to generate reports in an Excel spreadsheet format from a web
                  application. Firstly you need to have the program itself installed on the web server, which can be
                  difficult if you are using third party hosting. Also coding the solution itself is difficult as you
                  either need intimate knowledge of the Excel API or, for versions of office after 2007, in depth
                  knowledge of the OpenXML file format. But fear not there is a third option, open source to the rescue!
                  Some clever chaps have developed the <a href="http://epplus.codeplex.com/">EPPlus library</a> which
                  abstracts away all the nasty low level OpenXML calls and provides a nice object oriented API for
                  dealing with directly the spreadsheet.</p>

                <h2>Modelling the report data</h2>


                <p>I won&rsquo;t go into too much detail on the features of the library as you can read all about it on
                  the <a href="http://epplus.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=FAQ">EPPlus FAQ page</a> and download the
                  samples. However one of the methods that I found really useful was the <em>LoadFromArrays</em> method.
                  This enables a table of data to be output to the worksheet from a list of object arrays. So you can
                  construct a model of the data you want to display then feed it straight to the worksheet through the
                  list. It may sound quite complicated but here is a simple example that can be easily expanded with
                  more columns / rows:</p>

                <pre
                  style="font-family:Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace;color:#000000;background-color:#eee;font-size:12px;border:1px dashed #999999;line-height:14px;overflow:auto;width:100%;padding:5px;">string firstName = "Joe";
string lastName = "Bloggs";
var dateOfBirth = new DateTime(2000, 1, 1);
var testData = new List&lt;object[]&gt;()
                   {
                       new object[] {"First name", firstName},
                       new object[] {"Last name", lastName},
                       new object[] {"Date of birth", dateOfBirth}
                   };

using (var excelPackage = new ExcelPackage())
{
    ExcelWorksheet excelWorksheet = excelPackage.Workbook.Worksheets.Add("Test worksheet");
    //Loads the summary data into the sheet, starting from cell A1. Prints the column names on row 1
    excelWorksheet.Cells["A1"].LoadFromArrays(testData);
}</pre>




                <h2>Don&#8217;t get duped</h2>


                <p>I generally found that the EPPlus library was reliable, however I did hit a snag during the
                  development. The file would get generated OK but when I tried to open it in Excel a nasty message was
                  shown:</p>

                <blockquote>Excel found unreadable content in &#8216;Test export.xlsx&#8217;. Do you want to recover the
                  contents of this workbook?</blockquote>


                <p>The file did open OK if you chose to recover, however this obviously isn&rsquo;t ideal and not
                  acceptable for a client release. The tricky part was that no error was being thrown so I had to use a
                  bit of guess work to track down the issue. Initially there wasn&rsquo;t much to go on, however after
                  running some more tests on sample data I noticed that the export always worked fine if the file only
                  included a single worksheet. However sometimes multiple worksheets would cause the &lsquo;unreadable
                  content&rsquo; error. From there I examined each of the properties that were being set on the
                  worksheets and narrowed the problem down to be the worksheet name itself.</p>

                <p>It turns out that excel requires each worksheet to have a unique name. This is backed up in excel
                  itself if you try and manually name to worksheets the same you get a reasonably friendly error message
                  saying:</p>

                <blockquote>Cannot rename a sheet to the same name as another sheet</blockquote>


                <p>After ensuring my worksheets were uniquely named the reports always opened up without a problem. As
                  an aside I just tried to replicate this bug through EPPlus and this time it returned a much more
                  helpful error message, I wish it had told me this when I was originally working on the feature!</p>

                <blockquote>Add worksheet Error: attempting to create worksheet with duplicate name</blockquote>




                <h2>EPPlus for the win</h2>


                <p>In conclusion I would recommend EPPlus to anybody who needs to generate an excel report from C# code
                  and doesn&rsquo;t want to interface with the murky depths of the Excel API. It is a great open source
                  library that does just what you need in the way you would expect it to work.</p>

              <div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
                <p><a href="http://quartznet.sourceforge.net/index.html"><img class="alignright" title="Quartz rock"
                      src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Quartz,_Tibet.jpg/240px-Quartz,_Tibet.jpg"
                      alt="Quartz rock" width="168" height="169" /></a>A common requirement for e-commerce applications
                  is the ability to schedule jobs or tasks. I am currently working on a project which uses EPiServer
                  Commerce and I needed to schedule an order export job.</p>

                <p>I was pleasantly surprised to find that EPiServer Commerce is supplied bundled with the <a
                    href="http://quartznet.sourceforge.net/index.html">Quartz.NET</a> enterprise code library to
                  facilitate these job scheduling requirements.</p>

                <h3>Gentlemen, choose your weapons</h3>


                <p>I had three main options available for implementing the export job, a separate windows service, an
                  EPiServer CMS scheduled job or a Quartz job. I decided that the Quartz service was better than the
                  option of a separate windows service because the framework was already there and available so would
                  not increase the complexity of deployments. I also felt it was a better option than a EPiServer CMS
                  scheduled job because Quartz runs independently to the website app pool so should not put the web
                  application under greater load while it is running and potentially degrade the performance of the end
                  user website.</p>

                <h3>A 1000 foot example</h3>


                <p>I&rsquo;m not going to go into a massively detailed explanation of how to implement the jobs as there
                  is a already a good example available in the <a
                    href="http://sdk.episerver.com/commerce/1.1.1/Content/Developers%20Guide/Architecture/LongRunProcessScheduling.htm">EPiServer
                    Commerce dev guide</a> along with a detailed <a
                    href="http://quartznet.sourceforge.net/tutorial/index.html">tutorial on the Quartz .NET site</a>.
                  However a quick overview demonstrates how intuitive it is to implement.</p>

                <p>The first thing you need to do is create your job class which will run when Quartz triggers the
                  execution. The class must inherit from the IJob interface which just has a single Execute method to
                  implement. Here is a sample skeleton class:</p>

                <pre
                  style="font-family:Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace;color:#000000;background-color:#eee;font-size:12px;border:1px dashed #999999;line-height:14px;overflow:auto;width:100%;padding:5px;">    public class CommerceOrderExportJob : IStatefulJob
    {
        private readonly ILog _log;

        public CommerceOrderExportJob()
        {
            _log = LogManager.GetLogger(base.GetType());
            //Any other init code
        }

        public void Execute(JobExecutionContext context)
        {
            //Your export methods
        }
    }</pre>


                <p>You then need to extend the config file to configure Quartz to call your job. I think all the
                  parameters are pretty self explanatory:</p>

                <pre
                  style="font-family:Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace;color:#000000;background-color:#eee;font-size:12px;border:1px dashed #999999;line-height:14px;overflow:auto;width:100%;padding:5px;">&lt;job&gt;
    &lt;job-detail&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;OrderExportJob&lt;/name&gt;
      &lt;group&gt;all&lt;/group&gt;
      &lt;description&gt;This job exports orders from commerce&lt;/description&gt;
      &lt;job-type&gt;Your.Assembly.CommerceOrderExportJob, Your.Assembly&lt;/job-type&gt;
      &lt;volatile&gt;false&lt;/volatile&gt;
      &lt;durable&gt;true&lt;/durable&gt;
      &lt;recover&gt;false&lt;/recover&gt;
    &lt;/job-detail&gt;
    &lt;trigger&gt;
      &lt;simple&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;OrderExportJobTrigger&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;group&gt;eCommerceFramework&lt;/group&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;Fires Order Export Job&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;misfire-instruction&gt;SmartPolicy&lt;/misfire-instruction&gt;
        &lt;volatile&gt;false&lt;/volatile&gt;
        &lt;job-name&gt;OrderExportJob&lt;/job-name&gt;
        &lt;job-group&gt;eCommerceFramework&lt;/job-group&gt;
        &lt;repeat-count&gt;RepeatIndefinitely&lt;/repeat-count&gt;
        &lt;repeat-interval&gt;300000&lt;/repeat-interval&gt;
      &lt;/simple&gt;
    &lt;/trigger&gt;
  &lt;/job&gt;</pre>


                <p>Hit run on the service and check the event log for any problems. Make sure to include some useful
                  event/error logging in the job otherwise it will just be a mysterious black box! There are a couple of
                  snags you may run into when running the job against EPiServer Commerce:</p>

                <div>
                  <ul>
                    <li>ensure that your compiled assembly is actually available in the Quartz service directory, this
                      is different from the main commerce site bin folder so it is not enough just to include it in the
                      commerce app references</li>
                    <li>Make sure the data context has been initialised and the config file in the Quartz service
                      directory is pointing to your database</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>




                <h3>Mining for more gems</h3>


                <p>Ultimately only time will tell if Quartz was the best choice but I feel it has the best chance of
                  high reliability and performance in the long term. I hope that, where appropriate, EPiServer can
                  continue to expand the incorporation of proven open source libraries with their product offerings.</p>

              <div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
                <p>Most recent projects I have worked on have used unit tests to define the requirements of our code and
                  ensure they are met. Typically the tests are written by the developer while they are coding the
                  solution. However this means that the tests are based entirely on the developers understanding of the
                  requirements, which may not always be the same as the stakeholders understanding.</p>

                <p>To combat this issue we are introducing <a href="http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd/">behaviour
                    driven development</a>, to agree on a set of requirements for each feature with the stakeholders
                  before starting development. The requirements are captured using the Gherkin syntax (Given, When,
                  Then) based on real world examples. These examples can then be wired up to the system directly as
                  automated tests using <a href="http://specflow.org/">Specflow</a>.</p>

                <h2>OK, show me the example already</h2>


                <p>Here is a fictionalised scenario which demonstrates the value that BDD adds to a project. An
                  abbreviated version of the initial scenarios drafted by the developer are as follows:</p>

                <pre
                  style="font-size:small;font-family:Consolas, 'Courier New', Courier, Monospace;width:100%;overflow:auto;border:1px dashed #999999;background-color:#eeeeee;"><span style="color:#0000ff;font-weight:bold;">Feature</span>: Process 3D secure authentication response
        As a logged in user
        I would like to place a 3D secure authenticated order
        so that I have assurance of the websites security

<span style="color:#0000ff;font-weight:bold;">Scenario</span>: Handle a 3D secure response of AUTHORISED
    <span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong>Given </strong></span>a 3D secure response of AUTHORISED
        <span style="color:#0000ff;font-weight:bold;">When</span>  i view the order confirmation page
        <span style="color:#0000ff;font-weight:bold;">Then</span>  the order status will be Complete

<span style="color:#0000ff;font-weight:bold;">Scenario</span>: Handle a 3D secure response of NOT AUTHORISED
    <span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong>Given </strong></span>a 3D secure response of NOT AUTHORISED
        <span style="color:#0000ff;font-weight:bold;">When</span>  i view the order confirmation page
        <span style="color:#0000ff;font-weight:bold;">Then</span>  the order status will be Cancelled

<span style="color:#0000ff;font-weight:bold;">Scenario</span>: Handle a 3D response of NOT PROCESSED
    <span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong>Given </strong></span>a 3D secure response of NOT PROCESSED
        <span style="color:#0000ff;font-weight:bold;">When</span>  i view the order confirmation page
        <span style="color:#0000ff;font-weight:bold;">Then</span>  the order status will be Cancelled</pre>




                <h2>Evolving the scenario</h2>


                <p>The assumptions shown in these scenarios are perfectly reasonable, an order will only be completed if
                  the 3D secure security check returns an authorised response. However it should really be a decision
                  for the stakeholder&rsquo;s business whether the system should behave in this way. There are several
                  valid scenarios where all 3D responses should actually result in a completed order, for example:</p>

                <pre
                  style="font-size:small;font-family:Consolas, 'Courier New', Courier, Monospace;width:100%;overflow:auto;border:1px dashed #999999;background-color:#eeeeee;"><span style="color:#0000ff;font-weight:bold;">Scenario</span>: Handle a 3D secure response of NOT AUTHORISED
<span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong>Given</strong></span> a 3D secure response of NOT AUTHORISED
<span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong>And</strong></span> a total order value order value under the following amount:   25
<span style="color:#0000ff;font-weight:bold;">When</span>  i view the order confirmation page
<span style="color:#0000ff;font-weight:bold;">Then</span>  the order status will be Complete</pre>


                <p>The stakeholders calculated that the risk of charge-backs was so low on orders under 25 that they
                  could disregard the 3D secure response completely and allow &lsquo;not authorised&rsquo; transactions
                  to be completed.</p>

                <p>Here we can see a clear benefit in the stakeholder sharing their understanding of the system
                  requirements with the implementation team. Rules which are beneficial to their business can be
                  incorporated into the system, resulting in a more effective solution from the outset.</p>
