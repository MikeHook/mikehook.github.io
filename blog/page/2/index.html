	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p><a href="http://midsussextriclub.com"><img src="http://i49.photobucket.com/albums/f299/hookmike/MSTC%20_logo_yellow_280_zps4tnfm4qj.jpg" class="alignleft" alttext="MSTC Logo" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been a keen amateur triathlete and member the <a href="http://midsussextriclub.com">Mid Sussex Tri Club</a> for a couple of years. Its a relatively small club but there is a surprising amount of administration involved in running it and after chatting to some of the clubs committee members it was clear that the admin overheads were becoming a burden. I could see the potential for software to help lessen the burden so I offered to take on the club&rsquo;s website and add some features to it.</p>

<p>Fast forward a year and we have a greatly enhanced website with new features that have helped grow the club without taking up more of people&rsquo;s time. Throughout making these changes I&rsquo;ve applied Lean software principles which have really helped me. So in this post I&rsquo;m taking a look at the first 3 principles of Lean and how these have assisted on this project.</p>

<h2>Eliminate waste</h2>

<blockquote><p>Lean philosophy regards everything not adding value to the customer as waste.</p><footer><strong>Wikipedia</strong> <cite><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development'>Lean Software Development</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>I had great motivation to ensure that this principle was applied as I&rsquo;ve been making all the changes during my spare time. Its amazing what you can achieve in a short amount of time with a bit of planning. For example just last week I was able to add 2 new payment options to the site in an hour. The key techniques I&rsquo;ve used to help eliminate waste are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure I understand what the key stakeholder wants to achieve from the feature before implementing it</li>
<li>Design directly in HTML &ndash; I&rsquo;ve designed all the new user interfaces directly in HTML so when it comes to implementing the feature I just need to enhance the existing HTML with the dynamic data elements</li>
<li>Use third parties to do the heavy lifting (ie. don&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel). For this project the key third party systems used are <a href="http://umbraco.com/">Umbraco</a> for content management, <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> for styling and <a href="https://gocardless.com/">GoCardless</a> for online direct debit payments</li>
</ul>


<h2>Amplify learning</h2>

<blockquote><p>Software development is a continuous learning process with the additional challenge of development teams and end product sizes.</p><footer><strong>Wikipedia</strong> <cite><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development'>Lean Software Development</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Working in a development team of one on this particular project obviously made knowledge sharing a non issue, however there were opportunities to ensure learning was applied instead of doing things the old way. Integrating the GoCardless payment system presented a great opportunity for learning. The club were reluctant to extend the existing paypal based solution due to the fees involved, with paypal charging nearly 4% per transaction.  So I did some research and found that the GoCardless direct debit service charged just 1% per transaction.</p>

<p>We decided to trial the system and I was pleasantly surprised by how intuitive it was it integrate with. They have <a href="https://developer.gocardless.com/">top notch documentation of their API</a> and client libraries for a wide range of platforms including ours, .NET. I had a test payment process integrated with our website within a couple of hours, their support was also excellent and helped clarify the few points I wasn&rsquo;t clear on regarding setting up specific redirect URLs.</p>

<p>The system has been up and running for around 6 months now and the only issue we&rsquo;ve had was with some intermittent error responses. Again their support team looked into the problem as soon as I raised it and implemented a fix. I&rsquo;m glad that I took the time to learn how to integrate with GoCardless as it has saved our small club hundreds of pounds in fees already!</p>

<h2>Decide as late as possible</h2>

<blockquote><p>As software development is always associated with some uncertainty, better results should be achieved with an options-based approach, delaying decisions as much as possible until they can be made based on facts and not on uncertain assumptions and predictions.</p><footer><strong>Wikipedia</strong> <cite><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development'>Lean Software Development</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Taking this approach has helped me avoid the common &lsquo;analysis paralysis&rsquo; problem whereby you try and solve too many problems at once, tie yourself in knots and deliver nothing! I deferred the implementation of several tricky  features and was pleasantly surprised that the solutions turned out to be more straight forward than I&rsquo;d originally anticipated.</p>

<p>For example we wanted to add an online entry system for several club events however the we needed to accept entries from club members, affiliated club members or guests. My initial thinking was to have an entry form for each type of entrant with some reporting so the event organisers could see who had entered. This sounded like a big feature that would take weeks to implement. So I started by just adding a simple form for existing members to enter our Duathlon event (fortunately no guests were allowed for our Duathlon!). Later on I returned to the problem of adding guest entries and suddenly it became obvious to me that guests could be members of the website as well just with a different role to limit their access. Then the same entry forms could be used for everyone and I wouldn&rsquo;t have to add any new reporting. Deferring the decision for how to implement this feature saved me loads of time and resulted in a simpler system, wins all round!</p>

<h2>Stay tuned for part II&hellip;</h2>

<p>The first three principles of Lean development have really helped me deliver on this project but there are still four more principles to go, so if you&rsquo;ve found this interesting check back soon for part II in the series!</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="http://bakingwebsites.co.uk/2015/04/23/episode-VI/" itemprop="url">Software Development Episode VI - a New Dawn</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>As the somewhat cheesy title suggests, changes are afoot in the world of Baking Websites. Up to this point I&rsquo;ve been working as a permanent employee for a number of companies (five actually, hence Episode VI). But I felt that it was time to shake things up so imminently I will be starting out as a contracting software developer. While in practice I expect I will be doing much the same thing from day to day it was still quite a leap to leave the cosy environs of a permanent position. But before we get too far into that, in the best tradition of episodic film, lets take a recap on the story so far. In a galaxy far far away&hellip;</p>

<h2>Episode I &ndash; A lone padawan</h2>

<p>The first company I worked for, <a href="http://www.rfsolutions.co.uk/">RF Solutions</a>, was where I made my start on the journey of software development. Fresh out of university my mind was full of theory but completely devoid of any  practical business knowledge, invoices and purchase orders were foreign concepts to me! However that soon changed and I learnt what elements went together to make a business work.</p>

<p>After a brief foray into the world of &lsquo;technical sales&rsquo; I gravitated towards the IT systems and was given a pretty opened ended brief of &lsquo;build us a new website where we can sell our products.&rsquo; So off I went and built a site leveraging an e-commerce product called <a href="http://www.actinic.co.uk/">Actinic</a>. It was a fun challenge and I learnt much about how online payments worked along with how a web application could be integrated with internal business systems. I&rsquo;m pleased to see that both the site I built and Actinic themselves are still going strong today, all be it in evolved forms!</p>

<p>It gave me a taste for more and I set about learning all about the .Net framework and building my first custom application to process product returns. This was the first time I realized that the most difficult part can often be figuring out what you are meant to be making! It is one thing following tutorials to push data in and out of a database from a web page but quite another to apply that to a problem and come up with a solution that people will actually be able to use.</p>

<p>My custom application worked but I knew I could do better, if only I had some way of learning the best way to approach these problems. This was when I made my first leap of faith&hellip;</p>

<h2>Episode II &ndash; Yoda lives (in many forms!)</h2>

<p>It was no good me being in an IT department of one so I had to move on but the trouble was no company would take me on as an experienced developer. I was well aware that my skill set was limited but knew I could learn so I started out as a junior developer at <a href="https://twitter.com/cubeworks">Cubeworks</a>. This turned out to be one of the best decisions I ever made, the company was full of talented developers, and I went into full sponge mode absorbing a great deal about best coding practices, new frameworks and collaborating. I owe a massive debt of thanks to the guys who were working there at the time for putting up with my endless questions! Sadly Cubeworks is no more, however it does live on as part of a larger agency <a href="http://www.mba.co.uk/">MBA</a> and many of the sites I helped build are still out there (Amongst others <a href="http://www.chichester.ac.uk/">Chichester college</a>, <a href="http://www.motoringassist.com/">GEM Motoring Assist</a> and <a href="http://www.changinghabbits.co.uk/">Changing Habbits</a>).</p>

<h2>Episode III &ndash; Do or do not. There is no try</h2>

<p>Like a bolt out of the blue a digital agency from &lsquo;the big smoke&rsquo; called <a href="http://www.fortunecookie.co.uk/">Fortune Cookie</a> contacted me directly, offering me a position. It was a wrench to leave Cubeworks but the opportunity to work on big projects for international clients was too good to turn down. Again this proved to be a period of learning, however much more in how to work in big multidisciplinary teams than how to develop solutions. The first project I worked on had about 8 developers, several designers, user experience experts, project managers and one poor overworked QA guy all trying to work together to deliver software. It was obvious that the overheads for organising and communicating in a large development team increased exponentially with size. Also maintaining code quality across the project became a real challenge but more on that later!</p>

<p>The main program of work I was involved in was for <a href="https://www.netjets.com/">NetJets</a> a complete relaunch of their online presence, with a new flight booking engine thrown in for good measure! It was a great project to work on which involved close collaboration with the client across different time zones. It was soon clear that it was essential for us to maintain a &lsquo;mock&rsquo; version of the clients web services to enable us to work asynchronously, along with a suite of unit and integration tests to enable us to pin point the source of bugs. When a single user action is travelling through multiple layers of code across several applications debugging can be like going down the rabbit hole unless you have something to light your way!</p>

<h2>Episode IV &ndash; In a dark place we find ourselves, and a little more knowledge lights our way</h2>

<p>Unfortunately market forces conspired against me continuing to work for Fortune Cookie (or <a href="http://www.possible.com/">POSSIBLE</a> as they now were). The new projects were drying up and it was clear to me that long term the role would not be economical, so I decided to take action before someone made the decision for me. At the time the Test Driven Development movement was carrying a lot of influence in the industry and as I agreed with an approach to software development that put quality first I looked for a position that would align with my values.</p>

<p>At the time <a href="http://www.wiggle.co.uk/">Wiggle</a>, an e-commerce sports retailer, were hiring TDD focussed agile developers and I jumped at the chance to work for a great company I already knew from competing in triathlons and cycling events in my spare time. I was again lucky to join a development team full of talented people and learnt a great deal about both automated testing, event driven architecture and true agile development processes.</p>

<p>The whole team had a similar test first mindset and the benefits to a product of paired programming and code reviewing became clear. When members of a development team can freely collaborate then the solution benefits from their combined experience. Instead of a piecemeal code-base written from conflicting perspectives you produce a much more coherent product with consistent approaches to each particular problem.</p>

<h2>Episode V &ndash; Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future&hellip;</h2>

<p>Unfortunately events outside of my control once again forced me to look for alternative employment as the IT team was relocated. But working for Wiggle had given me a taste for working in a product team so I looked for a role in the same vein. Fortuitously Brightwave were looking to expand the development team for their tessello product so I jumped on board. The main product was quite a departure from all the applications I&rsquo;d worked on previously, a &lsquo;single page application&rsquo; with most of the code written in javascript to run client side directly in the users browser.</p>

<p>The benefits to this approach are obvious when you use the application as interactions are much smoother without full page reloads and the user experience is much better. There has been tremendous growth in this area over the last couple of years with the emergence of many front end frameworks such as Angular, Backbone, Ember, React (I could go on but you get the idea!). I expect that this approach will become the norm over the next few years as any applications without smooth interactions will not be able to attract users.</p>

<h2>Episode VI &ndash; Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose</h2>

<p>Working with the tessello product team was a great experience and we made some great improvements to the platform. However the pace of change in the technology industry is clearly not slowing down and I felt I needed to make a change to enable me to keep up with these rapid changes.</p>

<p>As a software developer (indeed any kind of knowledge worker) the most valuable commodity you possess is your time. Working for any company full time you effectively hand that commodity to the company and they apportion it as they see fit (quite rightly to, this is what we all sign up to when we join a company). However there is a problem with this model as opportunities to top up your knowledge bank are largely limited to concepts you encounter during your day to day work and whatever you can manage to cram in out of hours.</p>

<p>My hope is that contracting work will enable me to make a bigger investment into my knowledge bank between contracts. Also I may be able to explore other opportunities in my own time which may or may not be successful but I&rsquo;m sure will be fun trying! Obviously this is all theoretical right now but there is only one way to properly test a theory and that is to give it a go, so watch this space!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p><img src="http://imageshack.com/a/img539/1961/OgE8tH.jpg" class="alignleft" alttext="Tin Can API Logo" /></p>

<p>These are some notes from my reading on the Tin Can API, a specification for the transmission and storage of messages related to learning activities. The specification has been developed by parties in the e-learning industry and aims to be an elegant solution to enable learning systems to communicate with one another.</p>

<p>All this information is available on the <a href="http://tincanapi.com/">Tin Can API website</a>, this is just my own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn't_read">tl;dr</a> type summary.</p>

<h3>What is it?</h3>

<ul>
<li>A RESTful web service specification</li>
<li>Defines the structure for JSON messages which represent learning activities (Or other types of activity)</li>
<li>Each message is called a <strong>Statement</strong></li>
<li>A statement consists of 3 parts: <strong>Actor</strong>, <strong>Verb</strong> and <strong>Object</strong> like &ldquo;Mike read the Tin Can Explained article&rdquo;</li>
<li>Based on the <a href="http://activitystrea.ms/">activity streams</a> specification developed by/for social networks</li>
</ul>


<h3>Why is it good?</h3>

<ul>
<li>More flexible version of the old SCORM standard</li>
<li>Device agnostic &ndash; anything that can send HTTP requests can use the API</li>
<li>Almost any type of content can be stored</li>
<li>Decouples content from the LMS (Learning management system) by storing in a separate LRS (Learning Record Store)</li>
<li>A single <em>statement</em> can be stored in multiple learning record stores</li>
<li>Allows potential for a learner owning their own content instead of their employers</li>
<li>Data is accessible and easy to report on</li>
</ul>


<h3>A statement example</h3>

<pre><code>{
    "actor": {
        "name": "Sally Glider",
            "mbox": "mailto:sally@example.com"
        },
    "verb": {
            "id": "http://adlnet.gov/expapi/verbs/experienced",
            "display": {"en-US": "experienced"}
     },
    "object": {
            "id": "http://example.com/activities/solo-hang-gliding",
            "definition": {
                "name": { "en-US": "Solo Hang Gliding" }
            }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can generate test statements with valid syntax using the <a href="http://tincanapi.com/statement-generator/">Statement Generator</a></p>

<p>Details of the valid message formats are given on the <a href="https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI.md">full xAPI specification</a>.</p>

<h2>The registry</h2>

<ul>
<li>Contains definitions for verbs, activities, activity types, attachment types and extensions</li>
<li>Should be referenced to in messages by URIs</li>
<li>A shared domain language for agreed definitions of terms</li>
<li>Anyone can add their own definitions to <a href="https://registry.tincanapi.com/">the registry</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Recipes</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://tincanapi.com/recipeshow-it-works/">Recipes</a> provide a standardised way for people to describe activities</li>
<li>Simplifies reporting as the same terms should be used to describe things</li>
<li>A few recipes exist now, for example the <a href="https://registry.tincanapi.com/#profile/19">video recipe</a></li>
<li>More recipes can be added by the community</li>
<li>Helps keep the API flexible and useful for future applications that may not even exist yet!</li>
</ul>


<p>Reading about the Tin Can API over the last few days and seeing it in action in the <a href="https://www.tessello.co.uk">Tessello application</a> has really whet my appetite to work more with the specification. I can see great potential for systems that leverage this specification as it provides a flexible framework for messaging without being restrictive and gives us the basis for a common technical language to use to enable our systems to talk to one another.</p>

<p>Azure web site hosting has a great built in feature for deployment automation. All you need to do is point Azure at the location of your website in your source control platform and it will automatically monitor for updates, pull them into Azure and deploy them, Boom! Well that is the theory anyway, turns out in my case I needed to do some tweaking to get the automation to work.</p>

<h2>Tinkering under the hood</h2>

<p>The first step to set up the automated deployment is involves going to your Azure website dashboard and selecting &lsquo;Setup up deployment from source control&rsquo;. There are a bunch of options for what source control services are supported and how they can be setup, this is all pretty well documented in the <a href="" title="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-publish-source-control/">Azure publishing from source control article</a> so I won&rsquo;t rehash all of that here. Suffice to say I pointed the website at my github repo and sorted out all the authentication, then Azure pulled through a fresh version to deploy.</p>

<p>Unfortunately when I checked the shiny new &lsquo;Deployments&rsquo; tab I found that the deployment had failed, after looking in the error log the reason was clear enough:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Error: The site directory path should be the same as repository root or a sub-directory of it.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>My website was not in the root folder of the repository, it is in a &lsquo;website&rsquo; folder as you can see in the <a href="" title="https://github.com/MikeHook/MSTC">repo here</a>. so I needed to tell whatever magic was running these deployments to check in that folder instead for the code changes. After a bit of googling I found out that the deployments are driven by an application called kudu which has some documenation on its <a href="" title="https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki">github wiki</a>. Turns out that it is pretty straight forward to modify the folder, as explained on the <a href="" title="https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Customizing-deployments">customising deployments wiki page</a> I just had to add a .deployment file to the repository root with these contents:</p>

<pre><code>[config]
project = website
</code></pre>

<p>Simples, the deployment worked fine after adding that file&hellip; well it did when I just tried it but previously it didn&rsquo;t seem to work. Either I made some stupid syntax error previously or kudu got fixed since last time I tried!</p>

<h2>A robot to build a robot</h2>

<p>The actual website is running a different configuration based on a custom deployment script, while this is a little OTT to just change the folder path going the extra mile paid dividends later on when I needed to make some other customisations during the deployment. It was pretty straightforward to set up, thanks to the azure-cli tool which generates a deployment script for you based on a set of parameters. Instructions on how to do this are on the <a href="" title="https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Deployment-hooks">kudu wiki deployment hooks page</a>. In my case I just needed to run the following command from my repository root to generate a working .deployment and deploy.cmd file.</p>

<pre><code>azure site deploymentscript --aspWebSite -r website
</code></pre>

<p>Once checked in those files are used by kudu to control the automated deployment process. Check back in Azure and the deployment should now be showing as successful, awesome!</p>

<p>If you have read my previous post on <a href="http://bakingwebsites.co.uk/2014/04/28/migrating-umbraco-4-mysql-to-azure-hosting/">Umbraco to Azure migration</a> the topic of this post will be of no surprise.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve inherited an application using a MySQL database which I&rsquo;d like to host in Azure. However the hosting support for a MySQL database in Azure is expensive. So I have investigated migrating the DB into an SQL Azure supported format.</p>

<h2>What about a VM?</h2>

<p>That is a good question and one I didn&rsquo;t immediately consider. The Azure platform offers so many options that sometimes the most obvious can be missed. An easy way to keep the MySQL database without needing to fork out for the <a href="https://www.cleardb.com/">ClearDB</a> service is to just spin up an Azure VM, install MySQL on the VM and host everything from there.</p>

<p>This option offers a low overhead entry to hosting the site in Azure, with a lower cost than ClearDB. However I decided not to pursue it as it negates some of the advantages of cloud hosting, one of the aspects of Azure that is attractive is how streamlined you can make the deployment process, you can either download a publish profile and deploy directly from visual studio or hook it directly into your source control and deploy on check in. Also I must admit all the shiny monitoring graphs for Azure websites are pretty cool and give you great visibility of how your hosting is performing. Granted all these features could be achieved with a VM but not nearly so easily. So, onwards with the database migration challenge!</p>

<h2>Microsoft to the rescue! (nearly)</h2>

<p>After a bit of research I decided to try using the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ssma/">SQL Server Migration Assistant</a> to migrate the database. I was hoping this would automate all the tedious work and leave me just to press a few buttons, sit back and receive all the glory and admiration. Unfortunately it wasn&rsquo;t quite that simple as there are certain data types that just don&rsquo;t have a straight conversion between MySQL and SQL Server.</p>

<h3>How many ways can you say Yes and No?</h3>

<p>At last, a simple question, surely we can all agree what &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; and &lsquo;No&rsquo; look like, after all its the basis for all digital computing! Unfortunately when it comes to technology nothing is quite that straight forward. In the world of MS SQL we have a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms177603.aspx">bit data type</a> for this function, 1 for Yes, 0 for No, simples. However the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/bit-type.html">MySQL bit data type</a> also takes a length parameter so it is only equivalent to MS SQL if the length is set to 1.</p>

<p>To complicate things further MySQL actually advise in their <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/numeric-type-overview.html">numeric types overview</a> that a TINYINT(1) data type should be used to represent a boolean value. However the actual values of this type can be anything from -128 to 127, pretty crazy huh! Unfortunately the database I am trying to migrate chose the MySQL recommended data type of TINYINT(1) and, quite understandably that is not supported by SSMA (SQL Server Migration Assistant) as a straight migration to bit. My solution for this was to craft a &lsquo;pre migration&rsquo; script to manually convert all the MySQL booleans into a bit(1) data type, which could then be migrated by SSMA by adding a custom type mapping.</p>

<p>I also made a couple of other tweaks to the MySQL database before starting the conversion:</p>

<ul>
<li>Added primary keys to the identifying columns on the tables cmsmember, cmsstylesheet, cmsstylesheetproperty and umbracouserlogins</li>
<li>Cleared out temporary data stored in the cmspreviewxml and umbracolog tables and run optimize on the tables to free up unused space</li>
</ul>


<p>I was then ready to fire up the SSMA tool and migrate the database to Azure. I won&rsquo;t go into details about this as there is already a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ssma/archive/2011/02/07/mysql-to-sql-server-migration-how-to-use-ssma.aspx">decent guide for using SSMA</a>.</p>

<h2>The Devil is in the detail</h2>

<p>After the migration there was a final synchronisation step to carry out. I needed to manually check the data types for each of the columns in the Azure DB and update any that were not correct. I found out what the types were meant to be by <a href="http://our.umbraco.org/download">downloading the same umbraco version</a> I was working with and comparing the types. I expect there is a tool that can be used to do this but the database wasn&rsquo;t particularly large so it didn&rsquo;t take too long to carry out manually.</p>

<p>Most of the changes could be made directly to the Azure tables by just changing the datatype in the management tool. However a couple of columns proved more difficult, if they were being used as primary keys in azure there was no way to change them in place so instead I copied the data into a new table which had the correct schema, removed the old table and renamed the new table. Here is an example script for the cmstasktype table:</p>

<pre><code>EXECUTE sp_rename N'[PK_cmstasktype_ID]', N'[PK_cmstasktype_ID_old]',  'OBJECT'

CREATE TABLE [Tempcmstasktype](
    [ID] [tinyint] NOT NULL,
    [ALIAS] [nvarchar](255) NOT NULL    
    CONSTRAINT [PK_cmstasktype_ID] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED 
    ([ID] ASC
    )WITH (PAD_INDEX  = OFF, STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE  = OFF, IGNORE_DUP_KEY = OFF, ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS  = ON, ALLOW_PAGE_LOCKS  = ON) ) 
GO

Insert INTO [Tempcmstasktype] ([ID], [ALIAS])
    Select  [ID], [ALIAS]   From [cmstasktype]

drop table [cmstasktype]
EXECUTE sp_rename N'Tempcmstasktype', N'cmstasktype', 'OBJECT'
</code></pre>

<p>After ensuring all the data types matched I was able to fire up the azure website and hey presto everything functioned correctly! OK I admit it wasn&rsquo;t quite that smooth as I&rsquo;d missed changing one column from an int to tinyint which broke the whole CMS admin UI but once I&rsquo;d tracked that down everything worked fine, hooray!</p>
