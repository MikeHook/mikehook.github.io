There comes a time in a developers life (every couple of years it seems) when you are dissatisfied with your existing blogging platform. What had started as a beautiful and fulfilled relationship has decayed to the point where you barely interact. What once seemed like a cutting edge editing interface has become stayed and obtuse. Your eyes begin to wander, other blogging platforms seem so slick and modern in comparison, you wonder  &ldquo;why can&rsquo;t I have some of that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But there is no need to fret, unlike <a href="http://www.sheknows.com/tags/celebrity-breakups">other breakups</a> this change should be quite painless for all parties involved. So as January is the peak month for relationship change, there is no better time to ring the changes and introduce a new blogging platform!</p>

<h2>No more Batman and Robin</h2>

<p>You may ask what my blog has to do with the dynamic crime fighting duo Batman and Robin? Well the new platform is based on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, which is quite the opposite of dynamic. Using the power of Jekyll I can now generate all the static blog content (html, images, css) locally by running a couple of commands. Then I just push the changes up to <a href="https://github.com/">github</a> and boom, the updates are published.</p>

<p>I really liked the simplicity of this approach as a blog is pretty much all about the content, there are no interactive features or dynamically changing content that would require a processing engine. The functionality can be met with good old static html. There are also a bunch of other great advantages to this approach:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use of <a href="https://github.com/NeQuissimus/MarkdownByExample/wiki/MarkdownSyntax">Markdown</a> for content editing</li>
<li>Faster page load times</li>
<li>More tolerant to high loads (although I doubt the traffic on this particular blog will ever cause a problem!)</li>
<li>Free web hosting with <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/">github pages</a></li>
<li>Scratches my developer itch for getting my hands dirty with the blogging platform</li>
</ul>


<p>There are some drawbacks to this approach such as a higher barrier to entry for editors, however as I&rsquo;m the only editor that isn&rsquo;t a problem for me.</p>

<h2>Wordpress meet Octopress</h2>

<p>Having settled on a new platform I needed to extract the content from my existing wordpress blog and convert it into a format suitable for Octopress (ie. Markdown). Fortunately this is a fairly <a href="http://import.jekyllrb.com/">well travelled road</a> and my posts were pretty basically formatted so the conversion process was pretty painless. The most important issues for me were to not lose formatting of the content and retain the same permalinks so existing google / bookmark links would still work.</p>

<p>I got the blog running pretty easily (as it runs through Ruby, which is already setup on my machine) however the default theme wasn&rsquo;t really doing it for me. Fortunately there are a bunch of <a href="http://opthemes.com/">alternative themes</a> available that a pretty straightforward to apply. I opted to use the <a href="https://github.com/shashankmehta/greyshade">greyshade theme</a> as a base and tweak the fonts / layout to suit my needs.</p>

<h2>Images / Comments</h2>

<p>So at this point all the posts are in the blog nicely formatted but the images are still being served from Wordpress and even worse the comments have not been ported at all.</p>

<p>I considered just dumping the images into the new blog platform itself, however I felt like there should be a better solution. Whilst my blog is pretty tiny at the moment the number of assets are bound to grow over time and I didn&rsquo;t want to cripple the blog hosting server itself with unnecessary load. Initially I tried uploading the images to <a href="http://picasa.google.com/">Picasa</a>, however it seems to require a desktop app to upload the images and refused to give me a proper URL for the image sources. A far better solution for me was <a href="https://imageshack.com/">ImageShack</a>, uploading is handled through a slick browser based interface and you can easily get direct links to the images. A nice bonus for the platform is built in support for image resizing, all you need to do is specify your required size in the image link.</p>

<p>The final part to integrate was the comments. This turned out really straightforward using <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>. All I needed to do was sign up for a new account and point it at my existing wordpress blog to pull the comments down. You can enable Disqus in Octopress through the config.yml file.
Then, provided your post links are maintained, when the blog is switched across the comments are also kept, simples!</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>So there you have it, a freshly baked blogging site for your consumption pleasure, enjoy!</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="http://bakingwebsites.co.uk/2013/06/13/design-patterns-without-katas/" itemprop="url">Design Patterns Without Katas</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>There are a number of design patterns which I have chosen not to implement a coding kata for. This is because I felt that I would either not use the pattern regularly in practice or they have alternative solutions that make the pattern redundant. However I think it is worth calling out these patterns and summarising how they work.</p>

<h2>The decorator pattern</h2>


<p>This pattern provides a way of extending a classes behaviour without using inheritance, it is defined as:</p>

<blockquote>The decorator pattern extends the functionality of individual objects by wrapping them with one or more decorator classes. These decorators can modify existing members and add new methods and properties at run-time.</blockquote>


<p>The main reason I won&rsquo;t be using this pattern much in practice is that the class structure it generates is not very clear and also the behaviour of   the classes can change depending on the order they are instantiated. So I think implementing this pattern could cause more problems than it solves, especially if the system may need to be maintained by different people at a later date.</p>

<h2>The factory pattern</h2>




<blockquote><em>The factory method pattern allows for the creation of objects without specifying the type of object that is to be created in code. A factory class contains a method that allows determination of the created type at run-time.</em></blockquote>


<p>Whilst the factory method has its uses it is basically just an implementation of sub classing, where parameters are defined as base classes to allow different derived classes to be passed at runtime. It is a straightforward pattern and the coding kata would be pretty short to implement it.</p>

<p>Also one of the main issues the factory pattern tries to solve is centralising object creation, however we generally use IoC containers which provide <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/871405/why-do-i-need-an-ioc-container-as-opposed-to-straightforward-di-code">low maintenance dependency injection</a>  out of the box. So this removes the main need for the factory pattern.</p>

<h2>The Singleton pattern</h2>




<blockquote>Ensure a class only has one instance and provide a global access point to it</blockquote>


<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-460" alt="asparagus shoot from http://sandyspringcsa.com/" src="http://imageshack.com/a/img32/7137/uwa5.jpg" width="300" />
This is a pattern which can be very useful in applications, however the implementation is so short that a coding kata would have little content. There are just a couple of pitfalls to watch out for when implementing this pattern:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span style="line-height:16px;">Ensure the implementation is  thread safe
In Java the synchronized keyword can be used on the method which returns the singleton to ensure only a single thread ever has access to the class at once. However that can lead to the second pitfall</span></li>
    <li>Consider whether you implementation offers the best performance
Using synchronization is expensive (ie. It takes the computer a relatively long time to process)</li>
</ul>


<p>This implementation avoids both of these pitfalls by creating the <em>uniqueInstance</em> when the class is first loaded:</p>

<pre style="font-family:Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace;color:#000000;background-color:#eee;font-size:12px;border:1px dashed #999999;line-height:14px;overflow:auto;width:100%;padding:5px;">public class Singleton {
  private static Singleton uniqueInstance = new Singleton();

  private Singleton() {}

  public static Singleton getInstance()  {
    return uniqueInstance;
  }
}</pre>


<p>Finally, as with the factory pattern, if you are using an IoC container then they generally provide a way to configure a class as a singleton so there is rarely a need to implement this pattern manually yourself.</p>

<h2>There may be more&#8230;</h2>


<p>Stay tuned for more patterns to be added to this post!</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="http://bakingwebsites.co.uk/2013/05/29/the-observer-pattern-coding-kata/" itemprop="url">The Observer Pattern Coding Kata</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>The second design pattern I will be looking at is the Observer pattern, which is useful for safely passing data between objects. The Observer pattern is defined as:</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;a one-to-many relationship between objects so that when one object changes state all it  dependants  are notified and updated automatically&#8221;.</blockquote>


<p>A good analogy for this pattern, described in the excellent <a href="http://www.headfirstlabs.com/books/hfdp/">Head First Design Patterns book</a>  is that of a magazine publisher and subscribers. Here the publisher is the <em>one</em>  in the relationship and the subscribers are the <em>many</em>. Typically the publisher will notify each of the subscribers of a new magazine edition by sending them the magazine in the post or through their e-book subscription.  Translated into the Observer pattern the Publisher is known as the Subject and the subscribers are the observers. The subject <em>notifies</em> the observers of changes in its state.</p>

<p>Some important features to note about this pattern are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Observers can not change the state of the subject and vice versa (ie. they are Loosely Coupled)</li>
    <li>The state information can be either <em>pushed</em> out to the observers by the subject or <em>pulled</em> from the subject by the observers</li>
    <li>Observers can be added and removed at any time</li>
</ul>




<h3>The brief</h3>


<p>This is our  fictitious  brief for a new system which needs to be designed. It is election time and the polls are coming in. A local TV station would like us to design a system which can keep track of the results as they arrive. There are several hundred constituencies (areas of the country) which may declare for the Blue, Red, Yellow or Green party. The TV station wants to present this data in a number of ways:</p>

<ul>
    <li>As a leader board, showing the tally for each party</li>
    <li>As a map, with each region coloured to the winning party</li>
    <li>As a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8574653.stm">Swingometer</a>  showing the proportional change and overall result</li>
</ul>


<p>We don&rsquo;t need to worry about the implementation details of these display methods, the algorithms will be provided by the TV station. Our main concern is how to design a system to pass the data between the election object and the display objects.</p>

<h3>Designing the Solution</h3>


<p>Here is the class diagram for our solution, if you would like to try implementing the solution yourself the starting point for the kata is tagged here: <a href="https://github.com/MikeHook/DesignPatterns/tree/ObserverStart">Observer Pattern Kata Start</a>.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone" alt="Observer pattern for election data" src="https://www.lucidchart.com/publicSegments/view/51892f26-05fc-4844-a25b-4c660a0087f6/image.png" width="579" height="597" /></p>

<p>We have leveraged the Observer pattern in our solution. The Election object inherits from ISubject and each of the display methods inherit from IObserver. The Election object maintains a list of the observers, we can add or remove an observer to this list using the <em>Register</em> and <em>Unregister</em> methods. When the subjects <em>Notify</em> method is called it informs each of the observers that a change has occurred by calling their <em>Update</em> method. A completed implementation for the election scenario is tagged here: <a href="https://github.com/MikeHook/DesignPatterns/tree/ObserverEnd">Observer Pattern Kata End</a>.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I&rsquo;ve been having a look at coding katas and design patterns over the last couple of weeks. If you are not familiar with either of these concepts then you can read <a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata">Uncle Bob&rsquo;s introduction to the Bowling Kata</a> and check out <a href="http://www.blackwasp.co.uk/GofPatterns.aspx">Richard Carr&rsquo;s great set of articles on design patterns</a>.</p>

<p>My main goals are to:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span style="line-height:13px;">Increase my familiarity with design patterns</span></li>
    <li>Understand how design patterns can be best applied in real life situations</li>
    <li>Develop a repeatable method for memorizing the patterns</li>
</ul>


<p>A good way to cover off all of these goals will be to develop a set of code kata&rsquo;s which can be solved by applying a design pattern.  Sounds simple? Maybe but lets get started and see how it goes!</p>

<h2>The Strategy Pattern</h2>


<p>The strategy pattern is defined as<em>   </em></p>

<blockquote><em>&#8220;a design pattern that allows a set of similar algorithms to be defined and encapsulated in their own classes.&#8221; </em></blockquote>


<p>The aim of this pattern is to separate the parts of a system that may change from those which are unlikely to change, allowing for easier maintainability of the system in future.  This all sounds good in theory but you may be wondering how and where the pattern can be applied in practice. With this in mind I&rsquo;ve come up with a  fictitious brief that we can solve by utilising the Strategy Pattern.</p>

<h4>The brief</h4>


<p>A games company is developing a sports event simulator, to be built in iterations starting with simple requirements and building up to increase the complexity. The system design should allow for changes to be made by extending the existing system without changing what is already in place.</p>

<ol>
    <li>The simulator must support marathon and 10 km run events. The only requirement for these events is that the competitors can be displayed in some way (text is fine) and they can compete in the event. All competitors will compete by running.</li>
    <li>After running some events they proved to be totally chaotic so each event should now include a marshal. The marshal can also be displayed but does not compete in events.</li>
    <li>Since the glorious victory of team GB in the Olympic Triathlon the sport&#8217;s popularity has increased. So the games company would now like to also support triathlon events. Again competitors must be displayed and be able to compete, however a triathlon competitor will compete by swimming, cycling and running.</li>
</ol>




<h4>Designing the Solution</h4>


<p>The starting point for this kata is available to clone from github here: <a href="https://github.com/MikeHook/DesignPatterns/tree/StrategyStart">Strategy Kata Start</a>  <a href="https://github.com/MikeHook/DesignPatterns/tree/StrategyStart">
</a></p>

<h5>Iteration 1</h5>


<p>To meet the first requirement we only need a couple of objects as shown below:</p>

<p><img class="alignnone" alt="Strategy Pattern - Design iteration 1" src="https://www.lucidchart.com/publicSegments/view/5180e984-cb84-4274-a415-68870a00005a/image.png" width="637" height="405" /></p>

<p>We can create a couple of events for marathon and 10km runs and add some runners to those events. When the simulation runs the Compete() base method is called for each of the EventAttendees to simulate them taking part in the event. Each of the runners can be displayed by a call to their <em>Render()</em> method.</p>

<h5><span style="line-height:13px;">Iteration 2</span></h5>


<p>We now need to include Marshals as part of the event, so the model is extended as below:</p>

<p><img class="alignnone" alt="Strategy Pattern - Design iteration 2" src="https://www.lucidchart.com/publicSegments/view/518380c3-ab34-42c9-a96e-71dc0a005c5f/image.png" width="707" height="492" /></p>

<p>However, there is an obvious problem with this design, as noted in the diagram. One option would be for the Marshall to override the Compete method and make it do nothing. However this will store up more trouble for us as there may be other types of event attendee later which do not compete. We would have to ensure that each of these attendees also override that method with the same &lsquo;not compete&rsquo; behaviour. There is a better way to design for this issue (there is a clue in the name of this blog post!)</p>

<h5>Iteration 3</h5>


<p>It is clear that the Compete behaviour may change frequently depending on the attendee, we can leverage the Strategy pattern to extract this behaviour into separate classes as shown below.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone" alt="Strategy Pattern - Iteration 3" src="https://www.lucidchart.com/publicSegments/view/51877f21-1fd8-4c3b-9f02-04510a0087f6/image.png" width="519" height="496" /></p>

<p>The EventAttendee base class now contains a property of type ICompeteBehaviour. Any implementation of this interface can be assigned to each instance of an EventAttendee. So the <em>Runner</em> class is assigned the <em>Run </em>behaviour and the <em>Marshall</em> class is assigned the <em>DontCompete</em> behaviour.</p>

<p>Iteration 4</p>

<p>We have one more requirement to satisfy, the design needs to be extended to allow Triathlon events to take place. Thanks to our changes in the previous iteration we can add this new requirement without making any changes to the existing classes. Here is the final structure:</p>

<p><img class="alignnone" alt="Strategy Pattern - Iteration 4" src="https://www.lucidchart.com/publicSegments/view/51878405-1770-4c88-b91a-761b0a000882/image.png" /></p>

<p>We have extended the <em>EventAttendee</em> class with a new <em>Triathlete</em> class and created a new <em>RunCycleSwim</em> implementation of the <em>ICompeteBehaviour</em> interface. You may be thinking that the same could have been achieved with a method for the behaviour on the Triathlete class, while this is true it limits the flexibility of the design. We can see the advantage of this design by adding Spectators to the simulation. They will also be assigned the DontCompete behaviour, so we have effectively shared this part of the logic without repeating the implementation.</p>

<p>The completed implementation for this kata is available on github here:  <a href="https://github.com/MikeHook/DesignPatterns/tree/StrategyEnd">Strategy Kata End</a></p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>My previous blog post, <a title="Integrating EPiServer 7 with an existing MVC  site" href="http://bakingwebsites.co.uk/2013/03/14/integrating-episerver-7-with-an-existing-mvc-site/">Integrating EPiServer 7 with an existing MVC site</a>, outlined the initial steps to get EPiServer 7 running. However there are a number of additional steps you may need to take before your site is fully integrated.</p>

<h3>Convert any Controllers not in Areas</h3>


<p>If your site only contains controllers within Areas then you should not need to make any changes. However controllers in the root of the site will not work by default (at least for me). I found it was best to deal with these controllers on a case per case basis as the best course of action depended on the function of the controller. I implemented one of the following changes for each:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span style="line-height:13px;">Move the controller into an area. This option makes sense if the views for the controller do not have any CMS editable content</span></li>
    <li>Convert the controller to be CMS managed. Makes sense if the views need to be CMS editable (inherit from  PageController&lt;T&gt; where T is a BasePage)</li>
    <li>Convert the controller to an HttpHandler. In one case the controller did not have any views or models, it was really just a different entrypoint to the site which ran a bit of logic and redirected. In this case there was no point in retaining the controller as an HttpHanlder could do the same job more efficiently</li>
</ul>




<h3>Disable strict language routing</h3>


<p>I encountered a further issue after patching my EPiServer.Core and EPiServer.Framework nuget packages to the latest versions. None of the controller actions in the home controller worked any more except for the Index. This was fairly easy to remedy by disabling the strict language routing, via the episerver/sites/site/strictLanguageRouting config setting.</p>

<h3>Deployment Issues</h3>


<p>While its all well and good having the site running on your machine, eventually it will need to be deployed somewhere. We handle configuration changes with file transforms and I was pleased to note that the config changes required for episerver deployments are now minimised. Here is a summary list of all the settings we changed per environment:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span style="line-height:13px;">connectionStrings
</span></li>
    <li>episerver/sites/site/siteSettings/siteUrl</li>
    <li>episerver.framework/siteHostMapping/siteHosts</li>
    <li>episerver.framework/appData/basePath</li>
    <li>episerver.framework/licensing/licenseFilePath</li>
    <li>episerver.search/namedIndexingServices/services/baseUri</li>
</ul>


<p>Note, you may need to transform further settings for a load balanced site.</p>

<h5>EPiServer UI not deployed</h5>


<p>Previously with EPiServer v6 all that was needed to run the CMS interface itself was to install the application on the web server. However the EPiServer 7 UI architecture also has a number of dependencies in the {VPP}\modules folder. So ensure that these files are also present in your deployed environment, otherwise you will probably encounter the following error:</p>

<pre style="font-family:Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace;color:#000000;background-color:#eee;font-size:12px;border:1px dashed #999999;line-height:14px;overflow:auto;width:100%;padding:5px;">DirectoryNotFoundException: Could not find a part of the path '{Your site path} \Website\ClientResources\ClientResources\packages.config'</pre>




<h5>Search service configuration</h5>


<p>We have the search service configured on a local host name as the indexing service does not like to communicate over a public host name. However this caused a further issue with the service reporting that multiple hosts names could not be run for the service. Fortunately this could be remedied easily by setting the system.serviceModel/serviceHostingEnvironment/multipleSiteBindingsEnabled  setting to true.</p>

<p>Those were all the steps we needed to take to deploy the site successfully. I&rsquo;d be interested to hear your experiences if you found any other settings that need to be changed.
