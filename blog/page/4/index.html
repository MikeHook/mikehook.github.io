									itemprop="url">Strategy Pattern Coding Kata</a></h1>
							<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
								<p>I&rsquo;ve been having a look at coding katas and design patterns over the last
									couple of weeks. If you are not familiar with either of these concepts then you can
									read <a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata">Uncle
										Bob&rsquo;s introduction to the Bowling Kata</a> and check out <a
										href="http://www.blackwasp.co.uk/GofPatterns.aspx">Richard Carr&rsquo;s great
										set of articles on design patterns</a>.</p>

								<p>My main goals are to:</p>

								<ul>
									<li><span style="line-height:13px;">Increase my familiarity with design
											patterns</span></li>
									<li>Understand how design patterns can be best applied in real life situations</li>
									<li>Develop a repeatable method for memorizing the patterns</li>
								</ul>


								<p>A good way to cover off all of these goals will be to develop a set of code
									kata&rsquo;s which can be solved by applying a design pattern. Sounds simple? Maybe
									but lets get started and see how it goes!</p>

								<h2>The Strategy Pattern</h2>


								<p>The strategy pattern is defined as<em> </em></p>

								<blockquote><em>&#8220;a design pattern that allows a set of similar algorithms to be
										defined and encapsulated in their own classes.&#8221; </em></blockquote>


								<p>The aim of this pattern is to separate the parts of a system that may change from
									those which are unlikely to change, allowing for easier maintainability of the
									system in future. This all sounds good in theory but you may be wondering how and
									where the pattern can be applied in practice. With this in mind I&rsquo;ve come up
									with a fictitious brief that we can solve by utilising the Strategy Pattern.</p>

								<h4>The brief</h4>


								<p>A games company is developing a sports event simulator, to be built in iterations
									starting with simple requirements and building up to increase the complexity. The
									system design should allow for changes to be made by extending the existing system
									without changing what is already in place.</p>

								<ol>
									<li>The simulator must support marathon and 10 km run events. The only requirement
										for these events is that the competitors can be displayed in some way (text is
										fine) and they can compete in the event. All competitors will compete by
										running.</li>
									<li>After running some events they proved to be totally chaotic so each event should
										now include a marshal. The marshal can also be displayed but does not compete in
										events.</li>
									<li>Since the glorious victory of team GB in the Olympic Triathlon the sport&#8217;s
										popularity has increased. So the games company would now like to also support
										triathlon events. Again competitors must be displayed and be able to compete,
										however a triathlon competitor will compete by swimming, cycling and running.
									</li>
								</ol>




								<h4>Designing the Solution</h4>


								<p>The starting point for this kata is available to clone from github here: <a
										href="https://github.com/MikeHook/DesignPatterns/tree/StrategyStart">Strategy
										Kata Start</a> <a
										href="https://github.com/MikeHook/DesignPatterns/tree/StrategyStart">
									</a></p>

								<h5>Iteration 1</h5>


								<p>To meet the first requirement we only need a couple of objects as shown below:</p>

								<p><img class="alignnone" alt="Strategy Pattern - Design iteration 1"
										src="https://www.lucidchart.com/publicSegments/view/5180e984-cb84-4274-a415-68870a00005a/image.png"
										width="637" height="405" /></p>

								<p>We can create a couple of events for marathon and 10km runs and add some runners to
									those events. When the simulation runs the Compete() base method is called for each
									of the EventAttendees to simulate them taking part in the event. Each of the runners
									can be displayed by a call to their <em>Render()</em> method.</p>

								<h5><span style="line-height:13px;">Iteration 2</span></h5>


								<p>We now need to include Marshals as part of the event, so the model is extended as
									below:</p>

								<p><img class="alignnone" alt="Strategy Pattern - Design iteration 2"
										src="https://www.lucidchart.com/publicSegments/view/518380c3-ab34-42c9-a96e-71dc0a005c5f/image.png"
										width="707" height="492" /></p>

								<p>However, there is an obvious problem with this design, as noted in the diagram. One
									option would be for the Marshall to override the Compete method and make it do
									nothing. However this will store up more trouble for us as there may be other types
									of event attendee later which do not compete. We would have to ensure that each of
									these attendees also override that method with the same &lsquo;not compete&rsquo;
									behaviour. There is a better way to design for this issue (there is a clue in the
									name of this blog post!)</p>

								<h5>Iteration 3</h5>


								<p>It is clear that the Compete behaviour may change frequently depending on the
									attendee, we can leverage the Strategy pattern to extract this behaviour into
									separate classes as shown below.</p>

								<p><img class="alignnone" alt="Strategy Pattern - Iteration 3"
										src="https://www.lucidchart.com/publicSegments/view/51877f21-1fd8-4c3b-9f02-04510a0087f6/image.png"
										width="519" height="496" /></p>

								<p>The EventAttendee base class now contains a property of type ICompeteBehaviour. Any
									implementation of this interface can be assigned to each instance of an
									EventAttendee. So the <em>Runner</em> class is assigned the <em>Run </em>behaviour
									and the <em>Marshall</em> class is assigned the <em>DontCompete</em> behaviour.</p>

								<p>Iteration 4</p>

								<p>We have one more requirement to satisfy, the design needs to be extended to allow
									Triathlon events to take place. Thanks to our changes in the previous iteration we
									can add this new requirement without making any changes to the existing classes.
									Here is the final structure:</p>

								<p><img class="alignnone" alt="Strategy Pattern - Iteration 4"
										src="https://www.lucidchart.com/publicSegments/view/51878405-1770-4c88-b91a-761b0a000882/image.png" />
								</p>

								<p>We have extended the <em>EventAttendee</em> class with a new <em>Triathlete</em>
									class and created a new <em>RunCycleSwim</em> implementation of the
									<em>ICompeteBehaviour</em> interface. You may be thinking that the same could have
									been achieved with a method for the behaviour on the Triathlete class, while this is
									true it limits the flexibility of the design. We can see the advantage of this
									design by adding Spectators to the simulation. They will also be assigned the
									DontCompete behaviour, so we have effectively shared this part of the logic without
									repeating the implementation.
								</p>

								<p>The completed implementation for this kata is available on github here: <a

										End</a></p>

									itemprop="url">Integrating EPiServer 7 With MVC - Next Steps</a></h1>
							<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
								<p>My previous blog post, <a title="Integrating EPiServer 7 with an existing MVC  site"
										href="https://bakingwebsites.co.uk/2013/03/14/integrating-episerver-7-with-an-existing-mvc-site/">Integrating
										EPiServer 7 with an existing MVC site</a>, outlined the initial steps to get
									EPiServer 7 running. However there are a number of additional steps you may need to
									take before your site is fully integrated.</p>

								<h3>Convert any Controllers not in Areas</h3>


								<p>If your site only contains controllers within Areas then you should not need to make
									any changes. However controllers in the root of the site will not work by default
									(at least for me). I found it was best to deal with these controllers on a case per
									case basis as the best course of action depended on the function of the controller.
									I implemented one of the following changes for each:</p>

								<ul>
									<li><span style="line-height:13px;">Move the controller into an area. This option
											makes sense if the views for the controller do not have any CMS editable
											content</span></li>
									<li>Convert the controller to be CMS managed. Makes sense if the views need to be
										CMS editable (inherit from PageController&lt;T&gt; where T is a BasePage)</li>
									<li>Convert the controller to an HttpHandler. In one case the controller did not
										have any views or models, it was really just a different entrypoint to the site
										which ran a bit of logic and redirected. In this case there was no point in
										retaining the controller as an HttpHanlder could do the same job more
										efficiently</li>
								</ul>




								<h3>Disable strict language routing</h3>


								<p>I encountered a further issue after patching my EPiServer.Core and
									EPiServer.Framework nuget packages to the latest versions. None of the controller
									actions in the home controller worked any more except for the Index. This was fairly
									easy to remedy by disabling the strict language routing, via the
									episerver/sites/site/strictLanguageRouting config setting.</p>

								<h3>Deployment Issues</h3>


								<p>While its all well and good having the site running on your machine, eventually it
									will need to be deployed somewhere. We handle configuration changes with file
									transforms and I was pleased to note that the config changes required for episerver
									deployments are now minimised. Here is a summary list of all the settings we changed
									per environment:</p>

								<ul>
									<li><span style="line-height:13px;">connectionStrings
										</span></li>
									<li>episerver/sites/site/siteSettings/siteUrl</li>
									<li>episerver.framework/siteHostMapping/siteHosts</li>
									<li>episerver.framework/appData/basePath</li>
									<li>episerver.framework/licensing/licenseFilePath</li>
									<li>episerver.search/namedIndexingServices/services/baseUri</li>
								</ul>


								<p>Note, you may need to transform further settings for a load balanced site.</p>

								<h5>EPiServer UI not deployed</h5>


								<p>Previously with EPiServer v6 all that was needed to run the CMS interface itself was
									to install the application on the web server. However the EPiServer 7 UI
									architecture also has a number of dependencies in the {VPP}\modules folder. So
									ensure that these files are also present in your deployed environment, otherwise you
									will probably encounter the following error:</p>

								<pre
									style="font-family:Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace;color:#000000;background-color:#eee;font-size:12px;border:1px dashed #999999;line-height:14px;overflow:auto;width:100%;padding:5px;">DirectoryNotFoundException: Could not find a part of the path '{Your site path} \Website\ClientResources\ClientResources\packages.config'</pre>




								<h5>Search service configuration</h5>


								<p>We have the search service configured on a local host name as the indexing service
									does not like to communicate over a public host name. However this caused a further
									issue with the service reporting that multiple hosts names could not be run for the
									service. Fortunately this could be remedied easily by setting the
									system.serviceModel/serviceHostingEnvironment/multipleSiteBindingsEnabled setting to
									true.</p>

								<p>Those were all the steps we needed to take to deploy the site successfully. I&rsquo;d
									be interested to hear your experiences if you found any other settings that need to
									be changed. Feel free to reply in the comments below or contact me directly on
									twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/michael_hook">@michael_hook</a>.</p>

							<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
								<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-408" alt="custom_integration"
										src="http://imageshack.com/a/img560/4853/3rqu.jpg" width="300" />This post
									assumes you have EPiServer 7 installed on your machine. If you don&rsquo;t have it
									then it is available from <a
										href="http://world.episerver.com/Download/Categories/Products/EPiServer-CMS/">EPiServer
										world</a> (once you have created an account).</p>

								<p>There are 2 main options for creating a new EPiServer 7 MVC stylee site:</p>

								<ul>
									<li><span style="font-size:13px;">Create a new Visual studio project (after
											installing &#8216;EPiServer 7 Visual Studio Integration&#8217;, available
											from </span><a style="font-size:13px;"
											href="http://world.episerver.com/Download/Categories/Products/EPiServer-CMS/">EPiServer
											world</a><span style="font-size:13px;">)</span></li>
									<li><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:19px;">Use the </span><a
											style="font-size:13px;line-height:19px;"
											href="http://world.episerver.com/Articles/Items/ASPNET-MVC-Templates-for-EPiServer-7-CMS/">EPiServer
											7 MVC templates package</a></li>
								</ul>


								<p>For integrating with an existing site I&rsquo;d recommend using option 1, as there
									are far less files to integrate. However it is well worth looking at the templates
									package as well as this demonstrates how models and views can be implemented with
									EPiServer 7.</p>

								<p>After creating the new Visual Studio project I remembered that EPiServer have a NuGet
									feed, and they do have the version 7 assemblies on NuGet. However the version
									numbers are slightly different to those used in the visual studio project, so make
									sure you specify the version numbers to NuGet when you install the packages (they
									are listed below). Here are the steps I followed in detail:</p>

								<ol>
									<li><span style="line-height:13px;">Created a new Visual studio project using the
											EPiServer Web Site (MVC) template
										</span></li>
									<li>Followed the EPiServer tutorial (<strong>link</strong>) to add a home page and
										set it to the &#8216;start page&#8217;</li>
									<li>Upgraded my existing site to MVC 4 by installing the Microsoft ASP.NET MVC 4
										nuget package (obviously not required if your existing site is already on MVC
										version 4.</li>
									<li>Copy across the connectionStrings.config, episerver.config,
										EPiServerFramework.config, EPiServerLog.Config and FileSummary.config files</li>
									<li>Update the siteUrl in episserver.config.</li>
									<li>Copy the AppData, IndexingService, modules and modules bin folders.</li>
									<li>Merge the web.config files - ensure the episerver.search baseUri is updated to
										point at your site address.</li>
									<li>Installed EPiServer 7 from Nuget feeds using these commands to get the correct
										versions:
										<ul>
											<li>Install-Package EPiServer.Framework -Version 7.0.859.1</li>
											<li>Install-Package EPiServer.CMS.Core -Version 7.0.586.1</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>Removed assembly references to Razor and System.WebPages.Razor (as was clashing
										with EPiServer versions)</li>
									<li>Update Controllers to inherit from PageController&lt;T&gt; where T is a PageData
										class.</li>
									<li>Update Global.asax to inherit from EPiServer.Global</li>
								</ol>




								<h2><strong>IoC containers clashing!</strong></h2>


								<p>OK, this is the tricky bit it gets quite involved but please stay with me!</p>

								<p>When I tried to run the site it now returned a &lsquo;No parameterless construct or
									defined for this object.&rsquo; message. Which in plainer English means the
									application can&rsquo;t create the Controller classes. This is because the site I am
									integrating with currently uses the Castle Windsor IoC container, however EPiServer
									uses the StructureMap IoC container internally. We definitely don&rsquo;t want two
									IoC containers and I can&rsquo;t see any evidence of the EPiServer container being
									swappable. So the only option here is to convert the current Windsor implementation
									to a StructureMap implementation. More information on Structure map can be found on
									the excellent <a href="http://docs.structuremap.net/">StructureMap documentation
										site</a>, however I think it is worth including an overview in this post as,
									whilst this isn&rsquo;t always going to be necessary for your site, I expect it will
									be a common problem.</p>

								<h4>Add StructureMap version 2.6.1.0</h4>


								<p><span style="font-size:13px;">This is available from NuGet (as this is the version
										used in the EPiServer 7 MVC templates package).
										The command to install is: </span><span style="font-size:13px;">Install-Package
										StructureMap -Version 2.6.1.0</span></p>

								<h4>Register your services with StructureMap</h4>




								<ul>
									<li><span style="font-size:13px;">Copy the StructureMapDependencyResolver and
											DependencyResolverInitialization classes from the EPiServer MVC templates
											project.</span></li>
									<li>Convert service registration calls to register services with StructureMap
										instead of Windsor. This is carried out in the ConfigureContainer method of the
										DependencyResolverInitialization class.</li>
								</ul>


								<p>For example here is a Windsor interface registration and its equivalent StructureMap
									registration:</p>

								<pre
									style="font-family:Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace;color:#000000;background-color:#eee;font-size:12px;border:1px dashed #999999;line-height:14px;overflow:auto;width:100%;padding:5px;">//Windsor registration - Here container is an implementation of IWindsorContainer
var myConfig = WebConfigurationManager.GetSection("myConfig") as MyConfig;
container.Register(Component.For(typeof(IMyConfig)).Instance(myConfig));</pre>




								<pre
									style="font-family:Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace;color:#000000;background-color:#eee;font-size:12px;border:1px dashed #999999;line-height:14px;overflow:auto;width:100%;padding:5px;">//StructureMap registration - Here container is of type ConfigurationExpression
var myConfig = WebConfigurationManager.GetSection("myConfig") as MyConfig;
container.For&lt;IMyConfig&gt;().Use(myConfig);</pre>


								<p>An example of a class registration with a singleton lifestyle:</p>

								<pre
									style="font-family:Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace;color:#000000;background-color:#eee;font-size:12px;border:1px dashed #999999;line-height:14px;overflow:auto;width:100%;padding:5px;">//Windsor registration
container.Register(Component.For(typeof(Cache)).Instance(HttpContext.Current.Cache).LifestyleSingleton());</pre>




								<pre
									style="font-family:Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace;color:#000000;background-color:#eee;font-size:12px;border:1px dashed #999999;line-height:14px;overflow:auto;width:100%;padding:5px;">//StructureMap registration

								<h4>Debugging your StructureMap registrations</h4>


								<p>You can debug structure map by adding this line:</p>

								<pre
									style="font-family:Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace;color:#000000;background-color:#eee;font-size:12px;border:1px dashed #999999;line-height:14px;overflow:auto;width:100%;padding:5px;">_container.AssertConfigurationIsValid();</pre>


								<p>Initially EPiServer was reporting many registration failures but you can delay the
									call until the InitComplete event is called in the DependencyResolverInitialization
									class. Then most of the EPiServer registrations have completed and it is easier to
									see if there are any issues with your own services.</p>

								<h4>Manually retrieving a service</h4>


								<p>Generally my services are injected into constructors automatically, however I had a
									couple of calls to retrieve services manually from the IoC container. For example,
									to retrieve an implementation of an interface called IMyService:</p>

								<pre
									style="font-family:Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace;color:#000000;background-color:#eee;font-size:12px;border:1px dashed #999999;line-height:14px;overflow:auto;width:100%;padding:5px;">_var myService = DependencyResolver.Current.GetService&lt;IMyService&gt;();</pre>




								<h4>Last steps</h4>


								<p>Hopefully your site will be running now, there is some additional configuration work
									you may want to do for EPiServer 7 VPP folders. But if you&rsquo;ve made it this far
									you will probably need a break!</p>

								<h5>Updated on 9th April 2013</h5>


								<p>Updated the list of config files which must be copied to include EPiServerLog.config
									and FileSummary.config</p>

									great aspects of the Git source control system is its flexibility. Almost any sticky
									situation you may encounter as a developer working with source control can be solved
									with Git.</p>

								<p>Take this scenario, you&rsquo;re halfway through writing a class for a new feature
									when you get a call.. the client has found a show stopping bug in the application
									and it needs to be fixed right away. To be able to fix the bug you will need to
									switch onto the live code branch but you can&rsquo;t go switching branches with a
									load of uncommitted changes. Now you don&rsquo;t want to commit your code as its
									half done and won&rsquo;t even compile right now, but you don&rsquo;t want to lose
									the changes either&hellip; <a
										href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Stashing"><em>git stash</em></a> to
									the rescue!</p>

								<p>When you issue the git stash command all your changes will be committed to a stack.
									Leaving you with no changes on your current working branch and free to branch where
									ever you want. So now you can switch to the live branch and do your bug fixing work.
									Once that is done you can simply move back to the feature branch and <em>apply</em>
									the stashed changes. Hey presto, you are back where you started with your
									uncommitted half complete work!</p>

								<p>If you really get into lots of parallel work you can stash multiple times, just be
									sure to remember that it is a stack and your last changes you have stashed will come
									back off stack first.</p>

									A landmark decision was made last week by Microsoft&rsquo;s ASP.NET web development
									team. They announced that three key technologies used to develop web applications,
									<a
										href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2012/03/27/asp-net-mvc-web-api-razor-and-open-source.aspx">ASP.NET
										MVC, Web API and Razor would be made fully Open Source</a><sup>1</sup>. This is
									a big step for a company built on the sales of Closed Source software. I&rsquo;m
									going to have a look at what I think this decision means for the consumers, who use
									software built with these technologies, and the stakeholders who commission the
									software.
								</p>

								<h2>Open Sesame</h2>


								<p>For those those not involved directly in software development, the moniker
									&lsquo;Open Source&rsquo; may conjure up images of magicians pulling rabbits out of
									a hat<sup>2</sup>. However the reality could be viewed as the opposite of magic as
									Open source demystifies the software development process. In the traditional
									&lsquo;Closed Source&rsquo; licencing model, software is made by a company behind
									closed doors and the code is encrypted before release to the public. The traditional
									thinking is that this protects the company by preventing third parties from stealing
									their intellectual property. This is a subject of <a
										href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_patent_debate">some debate</a> ,
									which I won&rsquo;t go into here. However it is clear that many businesses are
									currently successful without relying on restrictive software patents.</p>

								<p>In an Open Source licencing model, the full unencrypted source code will be published
									at the same time as the software itself (indeed often before-hand in the case of
									preview and beta releases). Also, as in the case of this announcement, public
									contributions may be accepted to modify the original source code. Naturally the
									acceptance process is completely at the discretion of software company, so unhelpful
									or damaging contributions will not be accepted.</p>

								<p>A good example of the Open Source model working commercially is the Android operating
									system released by Google. A massive range of mobile devices run Android and it is
									not only the key competitor to Apple&rsquo;s iOS (iPhones &amp; iPad operating
									system but has helped ensure that most devices using Microsoft&rsquo;s Windows
									Mobile operating system are sitting on the scrap heap. I for one am glad that there
									is healthy competition to the world of Apple and its clone army of i-device
									accolytes.</p>

								<h2>Software that Just Works</h2>


								<p>From a consumer or stakeholder viewpoint the natural desire is to want software that
									&lsquo;just works&rsquo; and to reach that goal we just need to fix all the bugs in
									the software. Unfortunately the belief that all software bugs can be fixed is
									generally infeasible given time and budget restraints, due to the nature of
									programming the two go hand in hand. In each piece of code there are many paths that
									can be travelled, much like a maze in a country mansion garden. If you ask 10
									different people to walk the maze the chances are each one will set off in a
									different direction. Most of them will hit a dead end before finding their way
									through and a nasty bug could be hiding at each of these dead ends!</p>

								<p>However Open Source software helps minimize the number bugs by accepting
									contributions to fix any that are found by the development community. In this way
									the software benefits from the knowledge of a much wider group of people than could
									be acheived if it was developed and maintained soley by a single company. Most
									software developers are driven by that itch to &lsquo;make stuff work&rsquo; and are
									only too happy to contribute to a project which helps make this happen. The end
									result is a product that is more reliable for the consumers and stakeholders and has
									the appearance of &lsquo;just working&rsquo;.</p>

								<h2>Security concerns</h2>


								<p>Typically the biggest obstruction to making software Open Source is the perceived
									risk to security. If anybody can view exactly how the software is operating then it
									is much easier for hackers to cause the software to break, exploit a vulnerability
									to propogate a virus or carry out other nefarious acts. The <a
										href="http://haacked.com/archive/2012/03/29/asp-net-mvc-now-accepting-pull-requests.aspx">indications
										by Phil Haack</a>, a former member of the MVC team, are that this decision by
									Mircosoft is no exception. So a great deal of credit should go to those involved at
									Microsoft for making change happen in their organization.</p>

								<p>Regarding the perceived risks to security, Open Source can actually reduce the risk
									for similar reasons to the improvement in relibility. Any security vulnerabilities
									will quickly be picked up by the community and fixed. The Open Source culture of
									continual improvement in the software makes for a much more secure product.</p>

								<p>Take the example of web browsers, a couple of years ago Microsoft&rsquo;s Internet
									Explorer browser had massive market share. However over time so many security
									vulnerabilities were exploited in the browser that the <a
										href="http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1037530/us-government-warns-internet-explorer">US
										government themselves warned against using the software</a>! Along came
									Mozilla&rsquo;s Firefox browser to save the day, with much improved security.
									Naturally Firefox has always been developed under an Open Source licence as
									explained in the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/about/manifesto.html">Mozilla
										manifesto</a>.</p>

								<h2>Future developments</h2>


								<p>The likelyhood is that this announcement will not trigger a deluge of community
									updates and fixes to the frameworks in question. I anticipate that a minority of
									change submissions will make it back into the frameworks themselves. However it does
									demonstrate an important change in mindset from Microsoft and may well signal the
									beginnings of a new approach for the organisation. It is clear that in the fast
									moving world of software and digital media you need to adapt to survive and it is
									encouraging that even massive organisations such as Microsoft are able to do this.
								</p>

								<h5>Footnote</h5>


								<p><sup>1</sup>While the MVC framework has been open source since its original release,
									this announcement widens the license model to the Web API and Razor frameworks and
									also marks the first time that Microsoft will accept public contributions to the
									open source frameworks. If you are unfamiliar with these technologies then further
									information is available on the Microsoft blah blah (LINK).</p>

								<p><sup>2</sup>Or maybe thats just my fertile imagination!</p>
