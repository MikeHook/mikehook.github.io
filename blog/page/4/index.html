	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-408" alt="custom_integration" src="http://imageshack.com/a/img560/4853/3rqu.jpg" width="300" />This post assumes you have EPiServer 7 installed on your machine. If you don&rsquo;t have it then it is available from <a href="http://world.episerver.com/Download/Categories/Products/EPiServer-CMS/">EPiServer world</a>  (once you have created an account).</p>

<p>There are 2 main options for creating a new EPiServer 7 MVC stylee site:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span style="font-size:13px;">Create a new Visual studio project (after installing &#8216;EPiServer 7 Visual Studio Integration&#8217;, available from </span><a style="font-size:13px;" href="http://world.episerver.com/Download/Categories/Products/EPiServer-CMS/">EPiServer world</a><span style="font-size:13px;">)</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:19px;">Use the </span><a style="font-size:13px;line-height:19px;" href="http://world.episerver.com/Articles/Items/ASPNET-MVC-Templates-for-EPiServer-7-CMS/">EPiServer 7 MVC templates package</a></li>
</ul>


<p>For integrating with an existing site I&rsquo;d recommend using option 1, as there are far less files to integrate. However it is well worth looking at the templates package as well as this demonstrates how models and views can be implemented with EPiServer 7.</p>

<p>After creating the new Visual Studio project I remembered that EPiServer have a NuGet feed, and they do have the version 7 assemblies on NuGet. However the version numbers are slightly different to those used in the visual studio project, so make sure you specify the version numbers to NuGet when you install the packages (they are listed below). Here are the steps I followed in detail:</p>

<ol>
    <li><span style="line-height:13px;">Created a new Visual studio project using the EPiServer Web Site (MVC) template
</span></li>
    <li>Followed the EPiServer tutorial (<strong>link</strong>) to add a home page and set it to the &#8216;start page&#8217;</li>
    <li>Upgraded my existing site to MVC 4 by installing the Microsoft ASP.NET MVC 4 nuget package (obviously not required if your existing site is already on MVC version 4.</li>
    <li>Copy across the connectionStrings.config, episerver.config,  EPiServerFramework.config, EPiServerLog.Config and FileSummary.config files</li>
    <li>Update the  siteUrl in  episserver.config.</li>
    <li>Copy the AppData, IndexingService, modules and modules bin folders.</li>
    <li>Merge the web.config files - ensure the  episerver.search baseUri is updated to point at your site address.</li>
    <li>Installed EPiServer 7 from Nuget feeds using these commands to get the correct versions:
<ul>
    <li>Install-Package EPiServer.Framework -Version 7.0.859.1</li>
    <li>Install-Package EPiServer.CMS.Core -Version 7.0.586.1</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li>Removed assembly references to Razor and System.WebPages.Razor (as was clashing with EPiServer versions)</li>
    <li>Update Controllers to inherit from  PageController&lt;T&gt; where T is a PageData class.</li>
    <li>Update Global.asax to inherit from  EPiServer.Global</li>
</ol>




<h2><strong>IoC containers clashing!</strong></h2>


<p>OK, this is the tricky bit it gets quite involved but please stay with me!</p>

<p>When I tried to run the site it now returned a &lsquo;No parameterless construct or defined for this object.&rsquo; message. Which in plainer  English  means the application can&rsquo;t create the Controller classes. This is because the site I am integrating with currently uses the Castle Windsor IoC container, however EPiServer uses the StructureMap IoC container internally. We  definitely  don&rsquo;t want two IoC containers and I can&rsquo;t see any evidence of the EPiServer container being swappable. So the only option here is to convert the current Windsor implementation to a StructureMap implementation. More information on Structure map can be found on the excellent <a href="http://docs.structuremap.net/">StructureMap documentation site</a>, however I think it is worth including an overview in this post as, whilst this isn&rsquo;t always going to be necessary for your site, I expect it will be a common problem.</p>

<h4>Add StructureMap version 2.6.1.0</h4>


<p><span style="font-size:13px;">This is available from NuGet (as this is the version used in the EPiServer 7 MVC templates package).
The command to install is:  </span><span style="font-size:13px;">Install-Package StructureMap  -Version  2.6.1.0</span></p>

<h4>Register your services with StructureMap</h4>




<ul>
    <li><span style="font-size:13px;">Copy the  StructureMapDependencyResolver and DependencyResolverInitialization  classes from the EPiServer MVC templates project.</span></li>
    <li>Convert service registration calls to register services with StructureMap instead of Windsor. This is carried out in the  ConfigureContainer method of the  DependencyResolverInitialization class.</li>
</ul>


<p>For example here is a Windsor interface registration and its equivalent StructureMap registration:</p>

<pre style="font-family:Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace;color:#000000;background-color:#eee;font-size:12px;border:1px dashed #999999;line-height:14px;overflow:auto;width:100%;padding:5px;">//Windsor registration - Here container is an implementation of IWindsorContainer
var myConfig = WebConfigurationManager.GetSection("myConfig") as MyConfig;
container.Register(Component.For(typeof(IMyConfig)).Instance(myConfig));</pre>




<pre style="font-family:Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace;color:#000000;background-color:#eee;font-size:12px;border:1px dashed #999999;line-height:14px;overflow:auto;width:100%;padding:5px;">//StructureMap registration - Here container is of type ConfigurationExpression
var myConfig = WebConfigurationManager.GetSection("myConfig") as MyConfig;
container.For&lt;IMyConfig&gt;().Use(myConfig);</pre>


<p>An example of a class registration with a singleton lifestyle:</p>

<pre style="font-family:Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace;color:#000000;background-color:#eee;font-size:12px;border:1px dashed #999999;line-height:14px;overflow:auto;width:100%;padding:5px;">//Windsor registration
container.Register(Component.For(typeof(Cache)).Instance(HttpContext.Current.Cache).LifestyleSingleton());</pre>




<pre style="font-family:Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace;color:#000000;background-color:#eee;font-size:12px;border:1px dashed #999999;line-height:14px;overflow:auto;width:100%;padding:5px;">//StructureMap registration
container.For(typeof(Cache)).Singleton().Use(HttpContext.Current.Cache);</pre>




<ul>
    <li><span style="font-size:13px;">Convert  </span><em style="font-size:13px;">IWindsorInstaller</em><span style="font-size:13px;">  implementations  to  </span><em style="font-size:13px;">Registry</em><span style="font-size:13px;">  subclasses.</span></li>
</ul>




<h4>Debugging your StructureMap registrations</h4>


<p>You can debug structure map by adding this line:</p>

<pre style="font-family:Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace;color:#000000;background-color:#eee;font-size:12px;border:1px dashed #999999;line-height:14px;overflow:auto;width:100%;padding:5px;">_container.AssertConfigurationIsValid();</pre>


<p>Initially EPiServer was reporting many registration failures but you can delay the call until the InitComplete event is called in the DependencyResolverInitialization class. Then most of the EPiServer  registrations have completed and it is easier to see if there are any issues with your own services.</p>

<h4>Manually retrieving a service</h4>


<p>Generally my services are injected into constructors automatically, however I had a couple of calls to retrieve services manually from the IoC container. For example, to retrieve an implementation of an interface called IMyService:</p>

<pre style="font-family:Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace;color:#000000;background-color:#eee;font-size:12px;border:1px dashed #999999;line-height:14px;overflow:auto;width:100%;padding:5px;">_var myService = DependencyResolver.Current.GetService&lt;IMyService&gt;();</pre>




<h4>Last steps</h4>


<p>Hopefully your site will be running now, there is some additional configuration work you may want to do for EPiServer 7 VPP folders. But if you&rsquo;ve made it this far you will probably need a break!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-364 alignright" alt="Annie the Contortionist" src="http://imageshack.com/a/img856/5731/jyt7.jpg" width="300" />One of the great aspects of the Git source control system is its flexibility. Almost any sticky situation you may encounter  as a developer working with source control can be   solved with Git.</p>

<p>Take this scenario, you&rsquo;re halfway through writing a class for a new feature when you get a call.. the client has found a show stopping bug in the application and it needs to be fixed right away. To be able to fix the bug you will need to switch onto the live code branch but you can&rsquo;t go switching branches with a load of uncommitted changes.  Now you don&rsquo;t want to commit your code as its half done and won&rsquo;t even compile right now, but you don&rsquo;t want to lose the changes either&hellip; <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Stashing"><em>git stash</em></a> to the rescue!</p>

<p>When you issue the git stash command all your changes will be committed to a stack. Leaving you with no changes on your current working branch and free to branch where ever you want. So now you can switch to the live branch and do your bug fixing work. Once that is done you can simply move back to the feature branch and <em>apply</em> the stashed changes. Hey presto, you are back where you started with your uncommitted half complete work!</p>

<p>If you really get into lots of parallel work you can stash multiple times, just be sure to remember that it is a stack and your last changes you have stashed will come back off stack first.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p><img class="alignright" title="Tux, the Linux Mascot" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Tux.png/220px-Tux.png" alt="" width="220" height="261" />
A landmark decision was made last week by Microsoft&rsquo;s ASP.NET web development team. They announced that three key technologies used to develop web applications, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2012/03/27/asp-net-mvc-web-api-razor-and-open-source.aspx">ASP.NET MVC, Web API and Razor would be made fully Open Source</a><sup>1</sup>. This is a big step for a company built on the sales of Closed Source software. I&rsquo;m going to have a look at what I think this decision means for the consumers, who use software built with these technologies, and the stakeholders who commission the software.</p>

<h2>Open Sesame</h2>


<p>For those those not involved directly in software development, the moniker &lsquo;Open Source&rsquo; may conjure up images of magicians pulling rabbits out of a hat<sup>2</sup>. However the reality could be viewed as the opposite of magic as Open source demystifies the software development process. In the traditional &lsquo;Closed Source&rsquo; licencing model, software is made by a company behind closed doors and the code is encrypted before release to the public. The traditional thinking is that this protects the company by preventing third parties from stealing their intellectual property. This is a subject of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_patent_debate">some debate</a>  , which I won&rsquo;t go into here. However it is clear that many businesses are currently successful without relying on restrictive software patents.</p>

<p>In an Open Source licencing model, the full unencrypted source code will be published at the same time as the software itself (indeed often before-hand in the case of preview and beta releases). Also, as in the case of this announcement, public contributions may be accepted to modify the original source code. Naturally the acceptance process is completely at the discretion of software company, so unhelpful or damaging contributions will not be accepted.</p>

<p>A good example of the Open Source model working commercially is the Android operating system released by Google. A massive range of mobile devices run Android and it is not only the key competitor to Apple&rsquo;s iOS (iPhones &amp; iPad operating system but has helped ensure that most devices using Microsoft&rsquo;s Windows Mobile operating system are sitting on the scrap heap. I for one am glad that there is healthy competition to the world of Apple and its clone army of i-device accolytes.</p>

<h2>Software that Just Works</h2>


<p>From a consumer or stakeholder viewpoint the natural desire is to want software that &lsquo;just works&rsquo; and to reach that goal we just need to fix all the bugs in the software. Unfortunately the belief that all software bugs can be fixed is generally  infeasible  given time and budget restraints, due to the nature of programming the two go hand in hand. In each piece of code there are many paths that can be travelled, much like a maze in a country mansion garden. If you ask 10 different people to walk the maze the chances are each one will set off in a different direction. Most of them will hit a dead end before finding their way through and a nasty bug could be hiding at each of these dead ends!</p>

<p>However Open Source software helps minimize the number bugs by accepting contributions to fix any that are found by the development community. In this way the software benefits from the knowledge of a much wider group of people than could be acheived if it was developed and maintained soley by a single company. Most software developers are driven by that itch to &lsquo;make stuff work&rsquo; and are only too happy to contribute to a project which helps make this happen. The end result is a product that is more reliable for the consumers and stakeholders and has the appearance of &lsquo;just working&rsquo;.</p>

<h2>Security concerns</h2>


<p>Typically the biggest obstruction to making software Open Source is the perceived risk to security. If anybody can view exactly how the software is operating then it is much easier for hackers to cause the software to break, exploit a vulnerability to propogate a virus or carry out other nefarious acts. The <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2012/03/29/asp-net-mvc-now-accepting-pull-requests.aspx">indications by Phil Haack</a>, a former member of the MVC team, are that this decision by Mircosoft is no exception. So a great deal of credit should go to those involved at Microsoft for making change happen in their organization.</p>

<p>Regarding the perceived risks to security, Open Source can actually reduce the risk for similar reasons to the improvement in relibility. Any security vulnerabilities will quickly be picked up by the community and fixed. The Open Source culture of continual improvement in the software makes for a much more secure product.</p>

<p>Take the example of web browsers, a couple of years ago Microsoft&rsquo;s Internet Explorer browser had massive market share. However over time so many security vulnerabilities were exploited in the browser that the <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1037530/us-government-warns-internet-explorer">US government themselves warned against using the software</a>!   Along came Mozilla&rsquo;s Firefox browser to save the day, with much improved security. Naturally Firefox has always been developed under an Open Source licence as explained in the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/about/manifesto.html">Mozilla manifesto</a>.</p>

<h2>Future developments</h2>


<p>The likelyhood is that this announcement will not trigger a deluge of community updates and fixes to the frameworks in question. I anticipate that a minority of change submissions will make it back into the frameworks themselves. However it does demonstrate an important change in mindset from Microsoft and may well signal the beginnings of a new approach for the organisation. It is clear that in the fast moving world of software and digital media you need to adapt to survive and it is encouraging that even massive organisations such as Microsoft are able to do this.</p>

<h5>Footnote</h5>


<p><sup>1</sup>While the MVC framework has been open source since its original release, this announcement widens the license model to the Web API and Razor frameworks and also marks the first time that Microsoft will accept public contributions to the open source frameworks. If you are unfamiliar with these technologies then further information is available on the Microsoft blah blah (LINK).</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>Or maybe thats just my fertile imagination!</p>

		<p><img class="size-full wp-image-332 alignleft" title="FootyLinksLogo" src="http://imageshack.com/a/img834/6565/3iks.jpg" alt="" width="150" />The very first version of Footy Links is now available for download from the Android Market.
You can get the app by opening the following website on your android device and press the &lsquo;Install&rsquo; button:
<a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=mhook.FootyLinks">Footy Links on the Android Market</a></p>

<h2>What is Footy Links?</h2>


<p>Footy links is a game designed to test your football knowledge by guessing clubs connecting premiership football players.  Make your guess by clicking on the blue text then selecting the club badge matching the answer.</p>

<p>There is a basic scoring system following these rules:</p>

<ul>
    <li>+1 point for every correct guess of a &#8216;top six&#8217; club</li>
    <li>+2 points for a correct guess of any other club</li>
    <li>-1 point each time you skip to another question without answering the previous one</li>
</ul>




<h2>Can I play it?</h2>


<p>If you have an Android based mobile device I hope so, it should work on any device with Android OS version 2.2 or above.

<h2>Is that it?</h2>


<p>As you may be able to tell from the title, in the spirit of agile development (or maybe just because I&rsquo;m lazy), this is an early version with the absolute minimum set of features. I really wanted to just get a version out there in the wild to see if it will work on anyone&rsquo;s phone other than my own!</p>

<p>But do not fear, more versions are planned with lots of exciting extra features, possibly including:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Harder difficulty levels - more links to guess between each of the players</li>
    <li>More advanced scoring system</li>
    <li>Multi-player games</li>
    <li>Online high score board</li>
    <li>Inclusion of all English leagues</li>
    <li>Inclusion of  European  league clubs</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Techy Bit</h2>


<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in how the app works behind the scenes, the source is freely available for viewing on my github account here:
<a href="https://github.com/MikeHook/FootyLinks">Footy  Links on github</a></p>

<p>The source consists of two applications</p>

<ul>
    <li>A .NET application written to import the football club and player data into a Sqlite database</li>
    <li>An android application for the game itself</li>
</ul>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>This post was drafted some time ago, so some of the details are lost in the mists of time. But I&rsquo;ll provide links to the source so anyone interested in doing something similar can start from there.</p>

<p>The android app I&rsquo;m developing needs to be able to connect to an existing SQLite database, there are not many examples of how to achieve this in the Android tutorials, however I was able to find some guidance in a post from another Android developer on the <a href="http://www.reigndesign.com/blog/using-your-own-sqlite-database-in-android-applications/">reigndesign blog</a></p>

<p>The key is that the database needs to be copied internally to the system directory on the device running the application before it can be accessed. This doesn&rsquo;t seem particularly efficient but I&rsquo;m sure Android had their reasons! My modified version of the code to do this is available from my github repository here:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/MikeHook/FootyLinks/blob/master/AndroidApp/src/mhook/FootyLinks/Data/FootyLinksSQLLiteHelper.java">FootyLinksSQLLiteHelper.java</a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also encountered a couple of other snags since then while working with the SQLite database.</p>

<h3>No password support</h3>


<p>Passwords do not appear to be supported at all for the Android applications. I&rsquo;d automatically added password protection to the database when creating it and it took me a while to figure out why eclipse was refusing to read it!</p>

<h3>Manually delete after schema changes</h3>


<p>I&rsquo;ve added some additional fields to the database over time. However initially they were not being copied into the version of the database in my device emulator. I found it was necessary to browse the emulator files themselves, using the DDMS perspective in Eclipse, and delete the old database file directly in the emulator file system.</p>
