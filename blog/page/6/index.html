							<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
								<p>I&rsquo;m sure many of you have heard about a chap called <a
										href="http://twitter.com/#!/timberners_lee">Tim Berners Lee</a> who is widely
									credited for inventing the world wide web as we know it today. The story is well
									known and I&rsquo;m not going to re-hash it here, however less is known about who
									may have come up with the first concept of the <a
										href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a>. You may be surprised
									to hear that the origins of the concept date back several centuries and take place
									on an entirely different continent, among a race of people commonly considered quite
									primitive and barbaric. Here&rsquo;s a little hint of who these people may have
									been.</p>

								<p><a href="http://imageshack.com/a/img835/4400/yrbq.jpg"><img
											class="size-medium wp-image-257" title="Machu_Picchu_1"
											src="http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/320x240q90/835/yrbq.jpg" alt=""
											width="320" /></a></p>

								<h2>The internet laid bare</h2>


								<p>You may well ask how the internet could exist centuries before computers had been
									invented or even the discovery of electricity. Naturally there was no way the
									internet as we know it today could be possible, however if we look at the abstract
									concept there are strong parallels. At it&rsquo;s heart the internet is a
									communications system made up of a group of connected devices. The power of the
									internet lies in its ability to efficiently send messages through the network from
									one node to another. When you open your web browser and type in www.google.co.uk
									your computer sends a message to the web server hosting google.co.uk asking for the
									web page. However this message is not sent directly from your computer to the google
									web server, this would be very inefficient as each person that wanted to view the
									google web page would first need to establish a connection to their web server. As
									more people tried to connect to the same page the response would get slower and
									slower until the number of connections reached its limit.</p>

								<h2>Routing to the rescue</h2>


								<p>The internet has an elegant solution to this problem. Instead of attempting to
									establish a direct connection between the two end points, each of the nodes in the
									network just connects to their nearest nodes. So the end points are indirectly
									connected through the network in a similar way to this lovely node diagram:</p>

								<p><img class="size-full wp-image-252" title="onethousandpaintings_small1-300x300"
										src="http://imageshack.com/a/img834/8784/z6g.gif" alt="Network nodes"
										width="300" /></p>

								<p>Each message is sent with the address of its final destination, each node only needs
									to know what direction to send the message in order to get it closer to its
									destination. In this way the message is naturally <a
										href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing">routed</a> on the most efficient
									path from its source to the destination. It is this concept if a nodal network and
									message routing that has strong parallels with a very old method of communications.
								</p>

								<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:20px;"><strong>An ancient Inca
											network</strong></span></p>

								<p>I recently took a trip to Peru to hike the Inca trail to Machu Picchu. So this post
									is a (hopefully interesting) way to shoehorn some of my holiday snaps onto this
									blog!</p>

								<p><a href="http://imageshack.com/a/img703/8159/inq4.jpg"><img
											class="size-medium wp-image-255" title="Machu_Picchu"
											src="http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/320x240q90/703/inq4.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								</p>

								<p>However quite apart from that I learnt a great deal about the fascinating Inca
									culture. Before the trip I had thought that there was essentially one Inca trail in
									Peru leading to Machu Picchu, how wrong I was! The Inca trails actually comprised of
									thousands of miles of pathways connected across the whole of the Inca empire. They
									were the key to enabling the Inca rulers establish and run the largest single empire
									in South America.</p>

								<p>One of the main uses of the trails was as a communications network. There were small
									guard posts dotted across the network, often high up in remote mountain areas. If
									the Inca ruler wanted to send a message they would encode it using a &lsquo;<a
										href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quipus">quipus</a>&rsquo;, a device made up
									of multi-coloured plied rope, threads and knots. The exact method of encoding has
									unfortunately been lost in time but it may well of been a binary system quite
									similar to one used by computers today. It would have been quite possible to encode
									fairly sophisticated messages in this way.</p>

								<p><img class="size-full wp-image-259" title="quipus"
										src="http://imageshack.com/a/img14/4521/fqto.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

								<p>The ruler would then pass the quipus to a messenger to deliver the message. However
									the messenger would only take the message to the nearest checkpoint, then pass it
									onto another messenger who would carry the message to the next checkpoint. Each
									checkpoint would be around 5-10 KM apart, more distance for flat sections and less
									for mountainous terrain. In this way each of the messengers could run between the
									checkpoints as fast as possible and the message itself would reach its destination
									far quicker than would otherwise be possible.</p>

								<p>To give you some indication of how efficient this system was during Inca times the
									capital city was Cuzco, situated at around 3,300 metres in the middle of the Andes
									mountains, several hundred miles from the coast. However the Inca king was able to
									eat fresh fish in the capital because it was sent over the Inca trail network. It is
									estimated that the same delivery made by road transport today takes longer than an
									equivalent delivery made over the Inca network in the 15th century!</p>

								<p>So now all the pieces of the puzzle are in place we can see that the Inca trail
									network used the some communication method as today&rsquo;s internet. The trail
									checkpoints are equivalent to an internet router, the messengers have now been
									replaced with fibre optic cables and of course the quipus is directly equivalent to
									an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_packet">IP network packet</a>. So
									there you have it, the Inca empire invented the alpha version of the internet.</p>

							<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
								<p>I&rsquo;m loving the <a

										pick command</a> in git right now, this is the scenario that it really helps me
									out for.</p>

								<p>I&rsquo;ve fixed a bug on the live branch, however before it can be published to the
									live website it needs to be tested. So I can first publish it to our UAT (user
									acceptance testing) site so the client can test the changes. However the UAT site
									already has a bunch of other unreleased features on it. If I merge my bug fix branch
									into the UAT branch it will overwrite some of the other feature changes.</p>

								<p>The solution here is to &lsquo;cherry pick&rsquo; just my changes from my bug fix
									branch and commit those to the UAT branch. In this way git doesn&rsquo;t merge all
									the other differences between the live and UAT branch.</p>

									itemprop="url">Nhibernate Generator Class for SQLite Databases</a></h1>
							<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
								<p>I&rsquo;ve been developing a mobile app for Android which needs to query data in an
									SQLite database. So the first task I needed to get done was to import data into the
									SQLite database. As I&rsquo;m more used to writing .NET applications which use the
									NHibernate ORM I decided to write an import program on this technology stack.</p>

								<p>For my first attempt at the import program I just wanted to focus on the import
									logic, so choose to use a &lsquo;known working&rsquo; NHibernate configuration with
									a MS SQL 2005 database. While this worked fine for me it did mean that I had to
									manually copy all of the data from the MS SQL database into the SQLite database
									before it could be used in the Android app. This was quite laborious so when I
									needed to modify the importer at a later date I decided to change the NHibernate
									configuration to point directly to the SQLite database instead. This was the updated
									config file used:</p>

								<pre
									style="font-family:Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace;color:#000000;background-color:#eee;font-size:12px;border:1px dashed #999999;line-height:14px;overflow:auto;width:100%;padding:5px;">&lt;hibernate-configuration  xmlns="urn:nhibernate-configuration-2.2" &gt;
    &lt;session-factory&gt;
        &lt;property name="connection.provider"&gt;NHibernate.Connection.DriverConnectionProvider&lt;/property&gt;
        &lt;property name="connection.driver_class"&gt;NHibernate.Driver.SQLiteDriver&lt;/property&gt;
        &lt;property name="connection.connection_string_name"&gt;FootyLinks&lt;/property&gt;
        &lt;property name="dialect"&gt;NHibernate.Dialect.SQLiteDialect&lt;/property&gt;
        &lt;property name="query.substitutions"&gt;true=1;false=0&lt;/property&gt;
    &lt;/session-factory&gt;
&lt;/hibernate-configuration&gt;</pre>


								<p>And this is an example of the connection string format:</p>

								<pre
									style="font-family:Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace;color:#000000;background-color:#eee;font-size:12px;border:1px dashed #999999;line-height:14px;overflow:auto;width:100%;padding:5px;">&lt;configuration&gt;
    &lt;connectionStrings&gt;
        &lt;add name="FootyLinks" connectionString="Data Source=C:\path_to_the_SQLite_database_file;Version=3"/&gt;
    &lt;/connectionStrings&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;</pre>


								<p>This configuration worked OK and the import program could connect to the SQLite
									database, however I hit a problem when trying to save new records to the database.
									This was the inner exception reported by NHibernate:</p>

								<blockquote>Abort due to constraint violation Club.Id may not be NULL</blockquote>


								<p>The problem was that the import program was using the default generator class of
									<em>identity </em>for in the NHibernate entity mappings. So NHibernate was expecting
									the database to generate the identity keys for the new records being saved to the
									database, however SQLite does not appear to support this. After some reading up on
									the options available for the <a
										href="http://nhforge.org/doc/nh/en/index.html#mapping-declaration-id-generator">NHibernate
										generator setting</a> I decided to try the <em>native </em>setting. As this
									should select the implementation supported by the database. However this
									didn&rsquo;t work either, I think because, of all the options <em>native</em> can
									select, none are actually supported by SQLite. So my next preferred selection was to
									use <em>increment,</em> this setting comes with a disclaimer that it should not be
									used in a cluster, which is absolutely fine as its very unlikely that I will ever be
									deploy the importer to a load balanced environment.
								</p>

								<p>The <em>increment</em> setting worked fine with the SQLite database and should
									streamline my workflow nicely for updating the app data .</p>
