<p>The software design process can sometimes be difficult to quantify. From an external perspective of a development team, requirements go in and working software comes out. But what exactly happens in the middle to turn the stakeholders hopes and dreams into reliable, executable code?</p>

<p>At its core software design is a methodical, incremental engineering process and there are no short cuts to this process if we want to produce good results. However making really great software that will stand the test of time often requires a little something extra, a bit of inspiration. So where exactly does that spark come from and how can we help create the conditions to nurture it?</p>

<h2>A sticky design problem</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve recently been working on a feature to enable users to update their profiles through a web application. This is a pretty standard problem however some extra complexities were introduced by the target platform. Chief among those was the user interface which needed to be asynchronous and fit in with the applications existing front end <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">SPA framework</a>.</p>

<p>I like to implement using the &lsquo;<a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/166409/tdd-outside-in-vs-inside-out">outside in</a>&rsquo; approach so began with the user interface, adding one section at a time then abstracting any common patterns to make them reusable. However, after a day at the coal face writing code I took a step back and wasn&rsquo;t pleased with my results. The code was reaching a point where I was struggling to keep track of the workflow in my own head which doesn&rsquo;t exactly bode well for the poor guy that would inevitably need to modify it 6 months down the line. The trouble was no matter how hard I stared at those lines of code a more elegant and simple solution would not present itself!</p>

<p>The very next day I woke up feeling sick and not be able to get into the office to finish implementing the UI. However, it may well have been the most productive &lsquo;time off&rsquo; work I&rsquo;ve had in some time. As I recuperated watching Hobbits and Orcs do battle on a grand scale my mind drifted back to the problems I&rsquo;d been having yesterday. It suddenly became clear to me that I had been abstracting at too low a level and trying to fit all of the behaviour into a single javascript module. However if I just created a single module per user profile element I could create a common &lsquo;interface&rsquo; for each module and easily iterate over them in the main module.</p>

<h2>Emergent architecture</h2>

<p>This new approach had all the hallmarks of a good design as my own reaction was along the lines of &lsquo;that is so obviously better, why didn&rsquo;t I just do it like that in the first place?!&rsquo; That is a pertinent question, and one that has probably troubled many a software developer. However my feeling is that often it is not possible to skip the &lsquo;bad design&rsquo; and go straight to the better solution because you don&rsquo;t know what all the problems are going to be until you start implementing. Thomas Edison summed this up nicely in one of his most famous quotes:</p>

<blockquote><p>What it boils down to is one per cent inspiration and ninety-nine per cent perspiration.</p><footer><strong>Wikiquote</strong> <cite><a href='https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison'>Thomas Edison</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>While its certainly true that experience can help you see patterns and spot the problems earlier I think it is a mistake to try and design everything meticulously up front. There is bound to be some devil in the detail which makes you pivot on the design halfway through so a lot of that up front time will have been wasted.</p>

<p>I find it is best to have a balance, with an initial high level draft plan for the implementation usually implemented through UML modelling. This helps guide lower level design decisions and keep one eye on the bigger picture. To make the lower level design decisions I try and stay agile, adapt the code as I&rsquo;m going along and keep complexity at a minimum.</p>

<h2>Encouraging those aha! moments</h2>

<p>Often my best ideas are formed away from the computer, hours or even days after the initial problem arose. The sub conscious mind is an amazing tool which can help you solve many intractable issues if you can give it the space and time to join up those dots. Despite what our employment contracts may say, software development really isn&rsquo;t a 9 to 5 job. In fact working &lsquo;harder&rsquo; during those office hours can sometimes be counter productive when it comes to making great software. Good decisions and great solutions are formed in relaxed and fresh minds, for that reason I&rsquo;d have to list my bike as one of my most essential software design tools!</p>

<p>As developers we can encourage good software design by focussing on a couple of key elements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Collaborate on design, decisions should be guided by <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ten-commandments-of-egoless-programming/">the ten commandments of egoless programming</a></li>
<li>Ensure your estimates include enough contingency to allow for rapid prototyping and iterations during implementation.</li>
<li>Stay pragmatic; aim high but know that perfection is subjective. Establishing coding standards can help guide when a design is good enough</li>
</ul>


<p>Do you have any particular techniques to help inspire your software designs? If so I&rsquo;d love to hear about them and try them out myself!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p><img src="http://i49.photobucket.com/albums/f299/hookmike/Pat-Morita_Karate_Kid_200_zpscufzef0b.jpg" class="alignleft" title="Pat Morita" /></p>

<p>The path to Git enlightenment can be a long one for a developer used to centralized source control such as SVN.</p>

<p>The first signs of trouble usually occur when trying to apply changes from one branch of code to another. Some file change conflicts are likely if the same source file has been changed on both branches. The source control system has no way to know which changes should be kept so it will quite rightly ask the developer to choose, however this can cause some difficulty if the changes have been made by someone else who may not even be around to ask what has happened.</p>

<p>I have a feeling that the great Mr Miyagi would have loved using Git, as patience and dedication to the ways of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control">DVCS</a> are well rewarded in time. Indeed, dealing with branches is one situation where patience is important to avoid introducing regression bugs.</p>

<blockquote><p>Patience, young grasshopper.</p><footer><strong>Wikipedia</strong> <cite><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kesuke_Miyagi'>Kesuke Miyagi</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>There are a couple of different techniques which can be used to bring the changes on two branches together and the Atlassian site has a great write up of these in it&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing/">merging vs rebasing article</a>. The article describes the following scenario, you have created a <strong>feature</strong> branch from the <strong>master</strong> and made some commits to your branch. Someone else has since made some changes to the master branch which you now need to include in your branch, to get these changes you can either merge or rebase.</p>

<p>My personal preference is to use the rebase command where possible for one key reason, <strong>merge conflicts are easier to resolve!</strong> The reason for this is that when rebasing you apply <strong>your changes</strong> on top of the master changes. This is different to a merge which will apply the master changes on top of your feature changes. So effectively any conflicts which occur will be due to changes made by yourself instead of someone else. My memory may not be great but I stand roughly 100% more chance of remembering something I&rsquo;ve done as opposed to something someone else has done!</p>

<p>Hopefully you can see the benefits of this and are thinking, &lsquo;great I&rsquo;m going to give that a go!&rsquo; But before you rush off a few words of warning, there is potential for things to go horribly wrong.</p>

<blockquote><p>First learn stand, then learn fly</p><footer><strong>Wikipedia</strong> <cite><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kesuke_Miyagi'>Kesuke Miyagi</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>The trouble comes if there are 2 people working on the feature branch who have both pushed changes to a remote repository. If you haven&rsquo;t fetched their changes before you push the rebased feature branch their changes will get overwritten and lost forever! That would be bad but Git does try to help you out by blocking the push, actually the only way you can push the rebased branch is by passing an extra parameter to <strong>force</strong> the push. So this acts as a nice reminder to think about what you are doing, only tick that &lsquo;force push&rsquo; box if you are sure your branch is fully up to date. Actually I&rsquo;d never use rebase if I had any doubt that anyone else might be working on the same branch as me.</p>

<p>A final note about rebase, it may be difficult to carry out with some Git GUI tools. Some of my colleagues like using <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">Source Tree</a> and I&rsquo;ll agree it does look nice, however it doesn&rsquo;t support this workflow well at all. After starting a rebase you get left in a weird limbo state and have to keep re-requesting to rebase the branches after each and every commit. Then once the rebase is complete there is no way to force the push through the UI, you have to drop down to the command line to complete the action. I&rsquo;d recommend giving <a href="https://code.google.com/p/gitextensions/">Git Extensions</a>, the reliable Ford Mondeo of Git GUIs, a go for this scenario, it work much more smoothly.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="http://bakingwebsites.co.uk/2015/07/26/lean-awesome-part-II/" itemprop="url">Making Awesome Software With Lean Principles - Part II</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p><img src="http://i49.photobucket.com/albums/f299/hookmike/74078639-2d6b-4179-883d-4be7d28c19c7_zpsbpo9illj.jpg" class="alignleft" title="Awesome image by Roberlan https://www.flickr.com/photos/roberlan" /></p>

<p>In the <a href="http://bakingwebsites.co.uk/2015/07/19/lean-awesome-part-I/">first part of Making awesome software with Lean principles</a> I started looking at how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development">Lean principles</a> have helped me while working on the <a href="http://midsussextriclub.com/">Mid Sussex Tri Club website</a>.</p>

<p>The first three principles <strong>Eliminating waste</strong>, <strong>Amplifying learning</strong> and <strong>Deciding as late as possible</strong> are all fundamental to help guide software development. However they only form part of the picture, there are still four more principles remaining that help guide our decisions so let&rsquo;s take a look at them now.</p>

<h2>Deliver as fast as possible</h2>

<blockquote><p>In the era of rapid technology evolution, it is not the biggest that survives, but the fastest. The sooner the end product is delivered without major defects, the sooner feedback can be received, and incorporated into the next iteration.</p><footer><strong>Wikipedia</strong> <cite><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development'>Lean Software Development</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the benefits of an iterative approach over and again throughout my professional life so I regard this as an essential principle to apply to all software projects. I put in place a pretty slick release process as one of the first changes I made and have been reaping the benefits ever since. Basically any check-ins on the master branch of the source code repository are immediately deployed to the website. I&rsquo;ve already blogged about how I set-up this <a href="http://bakingwebsites.co.uk/2014/07/02/automated-azure-deployments/">&lsquo;zero-click&rsquo; deploy process</a> and it has worked largely without problems since set-up.</p>

<p>However, this technique must be used with caution and certainly in tandem with the &lsquo;<strong>Build quality in</strong>&rsquo; principle. It is essential to ensure that a suitable branching process is in place too and changes can only be deployed once they have been tested. If you are working in a larger team I&rsquo;d recommend limiting write access to the master branch to a single person who can coordinate the deployments. While automation is great for productivity people still need to understand how it all works and retain control of the systems.</p>

<h2>Empower the team</h2>

<blockquote><p>The lean approach favors the aphorism &#8220;find good people and let them do their own job,&#8221; encouraging progress, catching errors, and removing impediments, but not micro-managing.</p><footer><strong>Wikipedia</strong> <cite><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development'>Lean Software Development</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>I have been fortunate to be involved with an organisation that trusted me to make the technical decisions. I presented my ideas on the features to implement and got feedback on any changes they thought may be needed. So I was empowered to make the changes as and when they were needed. However I also think it is important to &lsquo;bring the stakeholders with you&rsquo; when making the changes. This has several benefits, not only does it help ensure that the features are relevant, it also gives me some good candidates for people to test the system before it goes live, which brings me neatly onto the next principle!</p>

<h2>Build quality in</h2>

<blockquote><p>Conceptual integrity means that the system’s separate components work well together as a whole with balance between flexibility, maintainability, efficiency, and responsiveness.</p><footer><strong>Wikipedia</strong> <cite><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development'>Lean Software Development</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>As I mentioned earlier, this principle acts as a counterweight to some of the other Lean principles, such as <strong>Deliver as fast as possible</strong>, to help ensure that changes are not rushed and the software doesn&rsquo;t accumulate bugs and brittle implementations. For this project I&rsquo;ve not had the luxury of any other developers who could review the code, however I&rsquo;ve still ensured that changes are functionally reviewed before deploying them to the live site. To facilitate this I&rsquo;ve setup a &lsquo;staging&rsquo; environment using the same deployment technique running off a separate &lsquo;staging&rsquo; repository branch. I first implement the changes on the staging branch and only merge them into the live &lsquo;master&rsquo; branch once someone has tested them out on the staging website.</p>

<p>On one occasion I skipped the staging process and fate taught me a lesson! The update was to use an Umbraco plugin to automatically resize images but little did I know that there was a memory leak in the Umbraco plugin which meant the site quickly went over its memory allocation and Azure automatically took it offline. That was a nasty surprise to find on the live site and some load testing in the staging environment would certainly have helped!</p>

<h2>See the whole</h2>

<blockquote><p>By decomposing the big tasks into smaller tasks, and by standardizing different stages of development, the root causes of defects should be found and eliminated.</p><footer><strong>Wikipedia</strong> <cite><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development'>Lean Software Development</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>There are two key elements to the last principle, <strong>See the whole</strong>. I&rsquo;ve already talked about how the staging and live environments are standardized, in my case this was a fairly trivial exercise made easy by modern hosting tools such as Azure and github that enable multiple environments to be set up at very low cost. The small fee to run an extra Azure database is well worth the value it adds for  the club.</p>

<p>The second element recommends splitting tasks into smaller pieces and is certainly one that I&rsquo;d advocate. Limiting the number of changes made at any one time really helps with tracking down issues. Its a practice which I&rsquo;ve learnt the hard way over the years, it can be tempting to try and &lsquo;fix the world&rsquo; when you get your hands on a code-base and hammer out a high number of changes in a short time. However, not only does this massively increase the probability for bugs, it also makes finding them much more difficult. Looking for a bug in a commit with 50+ changed files isn&rsquo;t much fun!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve used the <a href="https://github.com/MikeHook/MSTC/issues">github issue tracker</a> on this project, which may seem a bit odd when there is no one else to share the work with, however it has helped keep me focussed on what I&rsquo;ve been trying to achieve, also its nice to get the satisfaction of pressing the &lsquo;Closed&rsquo; button after fixing each issue!</p>

<h2>Lean == Awesome</h2>

<p>I hope you&rsquo;ve enjoyed reading about my experiences with Lean principles. I&rsquo;d love to hear about any opinions you&rsquo;ve got regarding the way I&rsquo;ve interpreted the principles or how you&rsquo;ve used the principles to make your own awesome software, so feel free to comment on the posts below!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been a keen amateur triathlete and member the <a href="http://midsussextriclub.com">Mid Sussex Tri Club</a> for a couple of years. Its a relatively small club but there is a surprising amount of administration involved in running it and after chatting to some of the clubs committee members it was clear that the admin overheads were becoming a burden. I could see the potential for software to help lessen the burden so I offered to take on the club&rsquo;s website and add some features to it.</p>

<p>Fast forward a year and we have a greatly enhanced website with new features that have helped grow the club without taking up more of people&rsquo;s time. Throughout making these changes I&rsquo;ve applied Lean software principles which have really helped me. So in this post I&rsquo;m taking a look at the first 3 principles of Lean and how these have assisted on this project.</p>

<h2>Eliminate waste</h2>

<blockquote><p>Lean philosophy regards everything not adding value to the customer as waste.</p><footer><strong>Wikipedia</strong> <cite><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development'>Lean Software Development</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>I had great motivation to ensure that this principle was applied as I&rsquo;ve been making all the changes during my spare time. Its amazing what you can achieve in a short amount of time with a bit of planning. For example just last week I was able to add 2 new payment options to the site in an hour. The key techniques I&rsquo;ve used to help eliminate waste are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure I understand what the key stakeholder wants to achieve from the feature before implementing it</li>
<li>Design directly in HTML &ndash; I&rsquo;ve designed all the new user interfaces directly in HTML so when it comes to implementing the feature I just need to enhance the existing HTML with the dynamic data elements</li>
<li>Use third parties to do the heavy lifting (ie. don&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel). For this project the key third party systems used are <a href="http://umbraco.com/">Umbraco</a> for content management, <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> for styling and <a href="https://gocardless.com/">GoCardless</a> for online direct debit payments</li>
</ul>


<h2>Amplify learning</h2>

<blockquote><p>Software development is a continuous learning process with the additional challenge of development teams and end product sizes.</p><footer><strong>Wikipedia</strong> <cite><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development'>Lean Software Development</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Working in a development team of one on this particular project obviously made knowledge sharing a non issue, however there were opportunities to ensure learning was applied instead of doing things the old way. Integrating the GoCardless payment system presented a great opportunity for learning. The club were reluctant to extend the existing paypal based solution due to the fees involved, with paypal charging nearly 4% per transaction.  So I did some research and found that the GoCardless direct debit service charged just 1% per transaction.</p>

<p>We decided to trial the system and I was pleasantly surprised by how intuitive it was it integrate with. They have <a href="https://developer.gocardless.com/">top notch documentation of their API</a> and client libraries for a wide range of platforms including ours, .NET. I had a test payment process integrated with our website within a couple of hours, their support was also excellent and helped clarify the few points I wasn&rsquo;t clear on regarding setting up specific redirect URLs.</p>

<p>The system has been up and running for around 6 months now and the only issue we&rsquo;ve had was with some intermittent error responses. Again their support team looked into the problem as soon as I raised it and implemented a fix. I&rsquo;m glad that I took the time to learn how to integrate with GoCardless as it has saved our small club hundreds of pounds in fees already!</p>

<h2>Decide as late as possible</h2>

<blockquote><p>As software development is always associated with some uncertainty, better results should be achieved with an options-based approach, delaying decisions as much as possible until they can be made based on facts and not on uncertain assumptions and predictions.</p><footer><strong>Wikipedia</strong> <cite><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development'>Lean Software Development</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Taking this approach has helped me avoid the common &lsquo;analysis paralysis&rsquo; problem whereby you try and solve too many problems at once, tie yourself in knots and deliver nothing! I deferred the implementation of several tricky  features and was pleasantly surprised that the solutions turned out to be more straight forward than I&rsquo;d originally anticipated.</p>

<p>For example we wanted to add an online entry system for several club events however the we needed to accept entries from club members, affiliated club members or guests. My initial thinking was to have an entry form for each type of entrant with some reporting so the event organisers could see who had entered. This sounded like a big feature that would take weeks to implement. So I started by just adding a simple form for existing members to enter our Duathlon event (fortunately no guests were allowed for our Duathlon!). Later on I returned to the problem of adding guest entries and suddenly it became obvious to me that guests could be members of the website as well just with a different role to limit their access. Then the same entry forms could be used for everyone and I wouldn&rsquo;t have to add any new reporting. Deferring the decision for how to implement this feature saved me loads of time and resulted in a simpler system, wins all round!</p>

<h2>Stay tuned for part II&hellip;</h2>

<p>The first three principles of Lean development have really helped me deliver on this project but there are still four more principles to go, so if you&rsquo;ve found this interesting check back soon for part II in the series!</p>

<p>These are some notes from my reading on the Tin Can API, a specification for the transmission and storage of messages related to learning activities. The specification has been developed by parties in the e-learning industry and aims to be an elegant solution to enable learning systems to communicate with one another.</p>

<p>All this information is available on the <a href="http://tincanapi.com/">Tin Can API website</a>, this is just my own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn't_read">tl;dr</a> type summary.</p>

<h3>What is it?</h3>

<ul>
<li>A RESTful web service specification</li>
<li>Defines the structure for JSON messages which represent learning activities (Or other types of activity)</li>
<li>Each message is called a <strong>Statement</strong></li>
<li>A statement consists of 3 parts: <strong>Actor</strong>, <strong>Verb</strong> and <strong>Object</strong> like &ldquo;Mike read the Tin Can Explained article&rdquo;</li>
<li>Based on the <a href="http://activitystrea.ms/">activity streams</a> specification developed by/for social networks</li>
</ul>


<h3>Why is it good?</h3>

<ul>
<li>More flexible version of the old SCORM standard</li>
<li>Device agnostic &ndash; anything that can send HTTP requests can use the API</li>
<li>Almost any type of content can be stored</li>
<li>Decouples content from the LMS (Learning management system) by storing in a separate LRS (Learning Record Store)</li>
<li>A single <em>statement</em> can be stored in multiple learning record stores</li>
<li>Allows potential for a learner owning their own content instead of their employers</li>
<li>Data is accessible and easy to report on</li>
</ul>


<h3>A statement example</h3>

<pre><code>{
    "actor": {
        "name": "Sally Glider",
            "mbox": "mailto:sally@example.com"
        },
    "verb": {
            "id": "http://adlnet.gov/expapi/verbs/experienced",
            "display": {"en-US": "experienced"}
     },
    "object": {
            "id": "http://example.com/activities/solo-hang-gliding",
            "definition": {
                "name": { "en-US": "Solo Hang Gliding" }
            }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can generate test statements with valid syntax using the <a href="http://tincanapi.com/statement-generator/">Statement Generator</a></p>

<p>Details of the valid message formats are given on the <a href="https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI.md">full xAPI specification</a>.</p>

<h2>The registry</h2>

<ul>
<li>Contains definitions for verbs, activities, activity types, attachment types and extensions</li>
<li>Should be referenced to in messages by URIs</li>
<li>A shared domain language for agreed definitions of terms</li>
<li>Anyone can add their own definitions to <a href="https://registry.tincanapi.com/">the registry</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Recipes</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://tincanapi.com/recipeshow-it-works/">Recipes</a> provide a standardised way for people to describe activities</li>
<li>Simplifies reporting as the same terms should be used to describe things</li>
<li>A few recipes exist now, for example the <a href="https://registry.tincanapi.com/#profile/19">video recipe</a></li>
<li>More recipes can be added by the community</li>
<li>Helps keep the API flexible and useful for future applications that may not even exist yet!</li>
</ul>


<p>Reading about the Tin Can API over the last few days and seeing it in action in the <a href="https://www.tessello.co.uk">Tessello application</a> has really whet my appetite to work more with the specification. I can see great potential for systems that leverage this specification as it provides a flexible framework for messaging without being restrictive and gives us the basis for a common technical language to use to enable our systems to talk to one another.</p>
